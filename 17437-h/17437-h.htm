<h2>THE SCIENCE OF HEALTH</h2>
<p>Whether the British race is improving or degenerating?&nbsp; What,
if it seem probably degenerating, are the causes of so great an evil?&nbsp;
How they can be, if not destroyed, at least arrested?&mdash;These are
questions worthy the attention, not of statesmen only and medical men,
but of every father and mother in these isles.&nbsp; I shall say somewhat
about them in this Essay; and say it in a form which ought to be intelligible
to fathers and mothers of every class, from the highest to the lowest,
in hopes of convincing some of them at least that the science of health,
now so utterly neglected in our curriculum of so-called education, ought
to be taught&mdash;the rudiments of it at least&mdash;in every school,
college, and university.</p>
<p>We talk of our hardy forefathers; and rightly.&nbsp; But they were
hardy, just as the savage is usually hardy, because none but the hardy
lived.&nbsp; They may have been able to say of themselves&mdash;as they
do in a state paper of 1515, now well known through the pages of Mr.
Froude&mdash;&ldquo;What comyn folk of all the world may compare with
the comyns of England, in riches, freedom, liberty, welfare, and all
prosperity?&nbsp; What comyn folk is so mighty, and so strong in the
felde, as the comyns of England?&rdquo;&nbsp; They may have been fed
on &ldquo;great shins of beef,&rdquo; till they became, as Benvenuto
Cellini calls them, &ldquo;the English wild beasts.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
they increased in numbers slowly, if at all, for centuries.&nbsp; Those
terrible laws of natural selection, which issue in &ldquo;the survival
of the fittest,&rdquo; cleared off the less fit, in every generation,
principally by infantile disease, often by wholesale famine and pestilence;
and left, on the whole, only those of the strongest constitutions to
perpetuate a hardy, valiant, and enterprising race.</p>
<p>At last came a sudden and unprecedented change.&nbsp; In the first
years of the century, steam and commerce produced an enormous increase
in the population.&nbsp; Millions of fresh human beings found employment,
married, brought up children who found employment in their turn, and
learnt to live more or less civilised lives.&nbsp; An event, doubtless,
for which God is to be thanked.&nbsp; A quite new phase of humanity,
bringing with it new vices and new dangers: but bringing, also, not
merely new comforts, but new noblenesses, new generosities, new conceptions
of duty, and of how that duty should be done.&nbsp; It is childish to
regret the old times, when our soot-grimed manufacturing districts were
green with lonely farms.&nbsp; To murmur at the transformation would
be, I believe, to murmur at the will of Him without whom not a sparrow
falls to the ground.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The old order changeth, yielding place to the
new,<br />
And God fulfils himself in many ways,<br />
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our duty is, instead of longing for the good old custom, to take
care of the good new custom, lest it should corrupt the world in like
wise.&nbsp; And it may do so thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>The rapid increase of population during the first half of this century
began at a moment when the British stock was specially exhausted; namely,
about the end of the long French war.&nbsp; There may have been periods
of exhaustion, at least in England, before that.&nbsp; There may have
been one here, as there seems to have been on the Continent, after the
Crusades; and another after the Wars of the Roses.&nbsp; There was certainly
a period of severe exhaustion at the end of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign,
due both to the long Spanish and Irish wars and to the terrible endemics
introduced from abroad; an exhaustion which may have caused, in part,
the national weakness which hung upon us during the reign of the Stuarts.&nbsp;
But after none of these did the survival of the less fit suddenly become
more easy; or the discovery of steam power, and the acquisition of a
colonial empire, create at once a fresh demand for human beings and
a fresh supply of food for them.&nbsp; Britain, at the beginning of
the nineteenth century, was in an altogether new social situation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the great French war; and, indeed, ever since
the beginning of the war with Spain in 1739&mdash;often snubbed as the
&ldquo;war about Jenkins&rsquo;s ear&rdquo;&mdash;but which was, as
I hold, one of the most just, as it was one of the most popular, of
all our wars; after, too, the once famous &ldquo;forty fine harvests&rdquo;
of the eighteenth century, the British people, from the gentleman who
led to the soldier or sailor who followed, were one of the mightiest
and most capable races which the world has ever seen, comparable best
to the old Roman, at his mightiest and most capable period.&nbsp; That,
at least, their works testify.&nbsp; They created&mdash;as far as man
can be said to create anything&mdash;the British Empire.&nbsp; They
won for us our colonies, our commerce, the mastery of the seas of all
the world.&nbsp; But at what a cost&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Their bones are scattered far and wide,<br />
By mount, and stream, and sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Year after year, till the final triumph of Waterloo, not battle only,
but worse destroyers than shot and shell&mdash;fatigue and disease&mdash;had
been carrying off our stoutest, ablest, healthiest young men, each of
whom represented, alas! a maiden left unmarried at home, or married,
in default, to a less able man.&nbsp; The strongest went to the war;
each who fell left a weaklier man to continue the race; while of those
who did not fall, too many returned with tainted and weakened constitutions,
to injure, it may be, generations yet unborn.&nbsp; The middle classes,
being mostly engaged in peaceful pursuits, suffered less of this decimation
of their finest young men; and to that fact I attribute much of their
increasing preponderance, social, political, and intellectual, to this
very day.&nbsp; One cannot walk the streets of any of our great commercial
cities without seeing plenty of men, young and middle-aged, whose whole
bearing and stature shows that the manly vigour of our middle class
is anything but exhausted.&nbsp; In Liverpool, especially, I have been
much struck not only with the vigorous countenance, but with the bodily
size of the mercantile men on &rsquo;Change.&nbsp; But it must be remembered
always, first, that these men are the very &eacute;lite of their class;
the cleverest men; the men capable of doing most work; and next, that
they are, almost all of them, from the great merchant who has his villa
out of town, and perhaps his moor in the Highlands, down to the sturdy
young volunteer who serves in the haberdasher&rsquo;s shop, country-bred
men; and that the question is, not what they are like now, but what
their children and grand-children, especially the fine young volunteer&rsquo;s,
will be like?&nbsp; And a very serious question I hold that to be; and
for this reason:</p>
<p>War is, without doubt, the most hideous physical curse which fallen
man inflicts upon himself; and for this simple reason, that it reverses
the very laws of nature, and is more cruel even than pestilence.&nbsp;
For instead of issuing in the survival of the fittest, it issues in
the survival of the less fit: and therefore, if protracted, must deteriorate
generations yet unborn.&nbsp; And yet a peace such as we now enjoy,
prosperous, civilised, humane, is fraught, though to a less degree,
with the very same ill effect.</p>
<p>In the first place, tens of thousands&mdash;Who knows it not?&mdash;lead
sedentary and unwholesome lives, stooping, asphyxiated, employing as
small a fraction of their bodies as of their minds.&nbsp; And all this
in dwellings, workshops, what not?&mdash;the influences, the very atmosphere
of which tend not to health, but to unhealth, and to drunkenness as
a solace under the feeling of unhealth and depression.&nbsp; And that
such a life must tell upon their offspring, and if their offspring grow
up under similar circumstances, upon their offspring&rsquo;s offspring,
till a whole population may become permanently degraded, who does not
know?&nbsp; For who that walks through the by-streets of any great city
does not see?&nbsp; Moreover, and this is one of the most fearful problems
with which modern civilisation has to deal&mdash;we interfere with natural
selection by our conscientious care of life, as surely as does war itself.&nbsp;
If war kills the most fit to live, we save alive those who&mdash;looking
at them from a merely physical point of view&mdash;are most fit to die.&nbsp;
Everything which makes it more easy to live; every sanatory reform,
prevention of pestilence, medical discovery, amelioration of climate,
drainage of soil, improvement in dwelling-houses, workhouses, gaols;
every reformatory school, every hospital, every cure of drunkenness,
every influence, in short, which has&mdash;so I am told&mdash;increased
the average length of life in these islands, by nearly one-third, since
the first establishment of life insurances, one hundred and fifty years
ago; every influence of this kind, I say, saves persons alive who would
otherwise have died; and the great majority of these will be, even in
surgical and zymotic cases, those of least resisting power; who are
thus preserved to produce in time a still less powerful progeny.</p>
<p>Do I say that we ought not to save these people, if we can?&nbsp;
God forbid.&nbsp; The weakly, the diseased, whether infant or adult,
is here on earth; a British citizen; no more responsible for his own
weakness than for his own existence.&nbsp; Society, that is, in plain
English, we and our ancestors, are responsible for both; and we must
fulfil the duty, and keep him in life; and, if we can, heal, strengthen,
develop him to the utmost; and make the best of that which &ldquo;fate
and our own deservings&rdquo; have given us to deal with.&nbsp; I do
not speak of higher motives still; motives which to every minister of
religion must be paramount and awful.&nbsp; I speak merely of physical
and social motives, such as appeal to the conscience of every man&mdash;the
instinct which bids every human-hearted man or woman to save life, alleviate
pain, like Him who causes His sun to shine on the evil and on the good,
and His rain to fall on the just and on the unjust.</p>
<p>But it is palpable, that in so doing we must, year by year, preserve
a large percentage of weakly persons, who, marrying freely in their
own class, must produce weaklier children, and they weaklier children
still.&nbsp; Must, did I say?&nbsp; There are those who are of opinion&mdash;and
I, after watching and comparing the histories of many families, indeed,
of every one with whom I have come in contact for now five-and-thirty
years, in town and country, can only fear that their opinion is but
too well founded on fact&mdash;that in the great majority of cases,
in all classes whatsoever, the children are not equal to their parents,
nor they, again, to their grandparents of the beginning of the century;
and that this degrading process goes on most surely, and most rapidly,
in our large towns, and in proportion to the antiquity of those towns,
and therefore in proportion to the number of generations during which
the degrading influences have been at work.</p>
<p>This and cognate dangers have been felt more and more deeply, as
the years have rolled on, by students of human society.&nbsp; To ward
them off, theory after theory has been put on paper, especially in France,
which deserve high praise for their ingenuity, less for their morality,
and, I fear, still less for their common-sense.&nbsp; For the theorist
in his closet is certain to ignore, as inconvenient to the construction
of his Utopia, certain of those broad facts of human nature which every
active parish priest, medical man, or poor-law guardian has to face
every day of his life.</p>
<p>Society and British human nature are what they have become by the
indirect influences of long ages, and we can no more reconstruct the
one than we can change the other.&nbsp; We can no more mend men by theories
than we can by coercion&mdash;to which, by the by, almost all these
theorists look longingly as their final hope and mainstay.&nbsp; We
must teach men to mend their own matters, of their own reason, and their
own free-will.&nbsp; We must teach them that they are the arbiters of
their own destinies; and, to a fearfully great degree, of their children&rsquo;s
destinies after them.&nbsp; We must teach them not merely that they
ought to be free, but that they are free, whether they know it or not,
for good and for evil.&nbsp; And we must do that in this case, by teaching
them sound practical science; the science of physiology, as applied
to health.&nbsp; So, and so only, can we check&mdash;I do not say stop
entirely&mdash;though I believe even that to be ideally possible; but
at least check the process of degradation which I believe to be surely
going on, not merely in these islands, but in every civilised country
in the world, in proportion to its civilisation.</p>
<p>It is still a question whether science has fully discovered those
laws of hereditary health, the disregard of which causes so many marriages
disastrous to generations yet unborn.&nbsp; But much valuable light
has been thrown on this most mysterious and most important subject during
the last few years.&nbsp; That light&mdash;and I thank God for it&mdash;is
widening and deepening rapidly.&nbsp; And I doubt not that, in a generation
or two more, enough will be known to be thrown into the shape of practical
and proveable rules; and that, if not a public opinion, yet at least,
what is more useful far, a wide-spread private opinion, will grow up,
especially among educated women, which will prevent many a tragedy and
save many a life.</p>
<p>But, as to the laws of personal health: enough, and more than enough,
is known already, to be applied safely and easily by any adults, however
unlearned, to the preservation not only of their own health, but of
that of their children.</p>
<p>The value of healthy habitations, of personal cleanliness, of pure
air and pure water, of various kinds of food, according as each tends
to make bone, fat, or muscle, provided only&mdash;provided only&mdash;that
the food be unadulterated; the value of various kinds of clothing, and
physical exercise, of a free and equal development of the brain-power,
without undue overstrain in any one direction; in one word, the method
of producing, as far as possible, the mentem sanam in corpore sano,
and the wonderful and blessed effects of such obedience to those laws
of nature, which are nothing but the good will of God expressed in facts&mdash;their
wonderful and blessed tendency, I say, to eliminate the germs of hereditary
disease, and to actually regenerate the human system&mdash;all this
is known; known as fully and clearly as any human knowledge need be
known; it is written in dozens of popular books and pamphlets.&nbsp;
And why should this divine voice, which cries to man, tending to sink
into effeminate barbarism through his own hasty and partial civilisation,&mdash;&ldquo;It
is not too late.&nbsp; For your bodies, as for your spirits, there is
an upward, as well as a downward path.&nbsp; You, or if not you, at
least the children whom you have brought into the world, for whom you
toil, for whom you hoard, for whom you pray, for whom you would give
your lives,&mdash;they still may be healthy, strong, it may be beautiful,
and have all the intellectual and social, as well as the physical advantages,
which health, strength, and beauty give.&rdquo;&mdash;Ah, why is this
divine voice now, as of old, Wisdom crying in the streets, and no man
regarding her?&nbsp; I appeal to women, who are initiated, as we men
can never be, into the stern mysteries of pain, and sorrow, and self-sacrifice;&mdash;they
who bring forth children, weep over children, slave for children, and,
if they have none of their own, then slave, with the holy instinct of
the sexless bee, for the children of others&mdash;Let them say, shall
this thing be?</p>
<p>Let my readers pardon me if I seem to write too earnestly.&nbsp;
That I speak neither more nor less than the truth, every medical man
knows full well.&nbsp; Not only as a very humble student of physiology,
but as a parish priest of thirty years&rsquo; standing, I have seen
so much unnecessary misery; and I have in other cases seen similar misery
so simply avoided; that the sense of the vastness of the evil is intensified
by my sense of the easiness of the cure.</p>
<p>Why, then&mdash;to come to practical suggestions&mdash;should there
not be opened in every great town in these realms a public school of
health?&nbsp; It might connect itself with&mdash;I hold that it should
form an integral part of&mdash;some existing educational institute.&nbsp;
But it should at least give practical lectures, for fees small enough
to put them within the reach of any respectable man or woman, however
poor.&nbsp; I cannot but hope that such schools of health, if opened
in the great manufacturing towns of England and Scotland, and, indeed,
in such an Irish town as Belfast, would obtain pupils in plenty, and
pupils who would thoroughly profit by what they hear.&nbsp; The people
of these towns are, most of them, specially accustomed by their own
trades to the application of scientific laws.&nbsp; To them, therefore,
the application of any fresh physical laws to a fresh set of facts,
would have nothing strange in it.&nbsp; They have already something
of that inductive habit of mind which is the groundwork of all rational
understanding or action.&nbsp; They would not turn the deaf and contemptuous
ear with which the savage and the superstitious receive the revelation
of nature&rsquo;s mysteries.&nbsp; Why should not, with so hopeful an
audience, the experiment be tried far and wide, of giving lectures on
health, as supplementary to those lectures on animal physiology which
are, I am happy to say, becoming more and more common?&nbsp; Why should
not people be taught&mdash;they are already being taught at Birmingham&mdash;something
about the tissues of the body, their structure and uses, the circulation
of the blood, respiration, chemical changes in the air respired, amount
breathed, digestion, nature of food, absorption, secretion, structure
of the nervous system,&mdash;in fact, be taught something of how their
own bodies are made and how they work?&nbsp; Teaching of this kind ought
to, and will, in some more civilised age and country, be held a necessary
element in the school-course of every child, just as necessary as reading,
writing, and arithmetic; for it is after all the most necessary branch
of that &ldquo;technical education&rdquo; of which we hear so much just
now, namely, the technic, or art, of keeping oneself alive and well.</p>
<p>But we can hardly stop there.&nbsp; After we have taught the condition
of health, we must teach also the condition of disease; of those diseases
specially which tend to lessen wholesale the health of townsfolk, exposed
to an artificial mode of life.&nbsp; Surely young men and women should
be taught something of the causes of zymotic disease, and of scrofula,
consumption, rickets, dipsomania, cerebral derangement, and such like.&nbsp;
They should be shown the practical value of pure air, pure water, unadulterated
food, sweet and dry dwellings.&nbsp; Is there one of them, man or woman,
who would not be the safer and happier, and the more useful to his or
her neighbours, if they had acquired some sound notions about those
questions of drainage on which their own lives and the lives of their
children may every day depend?&nbsp; I say&mdash;women as well as men.&nbsp;
I should have said women rather than men.&nbsp; For it is the women
who have the ordering of the household, the bringing up of the children;
the women who bide at home, while the men are away, it may be at the
other end of the earth.</p>
<p>And if any say, as they have a right to say&mdash;&ldquo;But these
are subjects which can hardly be taught to young women in public lectures;&rdquo;
I rejoin,&mdash;Of course not, unless they are taught by women,&mdash;by
women, of course, duly educated and legally qualified.&nbsp; Let such
teach to women, what every woman ought to know, and what her parents
will very properly object to her hearing from almost any man.&nbsp;
This is one of the main reasons why I have, for twenty years past, advocated
the training of women for the medical profession; and one which countervails,
in my mind, all possible objections to such a movement.&nbsp; And now,
thank God, I am seeing the common sense of Great Britain, and indeed
of every civilised nation, gradually coming round to that which seemed
to me, when I first conceived of it, a dream too chimerical to be cherished
save in secret&mdash;the restoring woman to her natural share in that
sacred office of healer, which she held in the Middle Ages, and from
which she was thrust out during the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>I am most happy to see, for instance, that the National Health Society,
<a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15">{15}</a> which I earnestly
recommend to the attention of my readers, announces a &ldquo;Course
of Lectures for Ladies on Elementary Physiology and Hygiene, by Miss
Chessar,&rdquo; to which I am also most happy to see, governesses are
admitted at half-fees.&nbsp; Alas! how much misery, disease, and even
death, might have been prevented, had governesses been taught such matters
thirty years ago, I, for one, know too well.&nbsp; May the day soon
come when there will be educated women enough to give such lectures
throughout these realms, to rich as well as poor,&mdash;for the rich,
strange to say, need them often as much as the poor do,&mdash;and that
we may live to see, in every great town, health classes for women as
well as for men, sending forth year by year more young women and young
men taught, not only to take care of themselves and of their families,
but to exercise moral influence over their fellow-citizens, as champions
in the battle against dirt and drunkenness, disease and death.</p>
<p>There may be those who would answer&mdash;or rather, there would
certainly have been those who would have so answered thirty years ago,
before the so-called materialism of advanced science had taught us some
practical wisdom about education, and reminded people that they have
bodies as well as minds and souls&mdash;&ldquo;You say, we are likely
to grow weaklier, unhealthier.&nbsp; And if it were so, what matter?&nbsp;
Mind makes the man, not body.&nbsp; We do not want our children to be
stupid giants and bravos; but clever, able, highly educated, however
weakly Providence or the laws of nature may have chosen to make them.&nbsp;
Let them overstrain their brains a little; let them contract their chests,
and injure their digestion and their eyesight, by sitting at desks,
poring over books.&nbsp; Intellect is what we want.&nbsp; Intellect
makes money.&nbsp; Intellect makes the world.&nbsp; We would rather
see our son a genius than an athlete.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well: and so would
I.&nbsp; But what if intellect alone does not even make money, save
as Messrs. Dodson &amp; Fogg, Sampson Brass, and Montagu Tigg were wont
to make it, unless backed by an able, enduring, healthy physique, such
as I have seen, almost without exception, in those successful men of
business whom I have had the honour and the pleasure of knowing?&nbsp;
What if intellect, or what is now called intellect, did not make the
world, or the smallest wheel or cog of it?&nbsp; What if, for want of
obeying the laws of nature, parents bred up neither a genius nor an
athlete, but only an incapable unhappy personage, with a huge upright
forehead, like that of a Byzantine Greek, filled with some sort of pap
instead of brains, and tempted alternately to fanaticism and strong
drink?&nbsp; We must, in the great majority of cases have the corpus
sanem if we want the mentem sanem; and healthy bodies are the only trustworthy
organs for healthy minds.&nbsp; Which is cause and which is effect,
I shall not stay to debate here.&nbsp; But wherever we find a population
generally weakly, stunted, scrofulous, we find in them a corresponding
type of brain, which cannot be trusted to do good work; which is capable
more or less of madness, whether solitary or epidemic.&nbsp; It may
be very active; it may be very quick at catching at new and grand ideas&mdash;all
the more quick, perhaps, on account of its own secret <i>malaise</i>
and self-discontent: but it will be irritable, spasmodic, hysterical.&nbsp;
It will be apt to mistake capacity of talk for capacity of action, excitement
for earnestness, virulence for force, and, too often, cruelty for justice.&nbsp;
It will lose manful independence, individuality, originality; and when
men act, they will act, from the consciousness of personal weakness,
like sheep rushing over a hedge, leaning against each other, exhorting
each other to be brave, and swaying about in mobs and masses.&nbsp;
These were the intellectual weaknesses which, as I read history, followed
on physical degradation in Imperial Rome, in Alexandria, in Byzantium.&nbsp;
Have we not seen them reappear, under fearful forms, in Paris but the
other day?</p>
<p>I do not blame; I do not judge.&nbsp; My theory, which I hold, and
shall hold, to be fairly founded on a wide induction, forbids me to
blame and to judge: because it tells me that these defects are mainly
physical; that those who exhibit them are mainly to be pitied, as victims
of the sins or ignorance of their forefathers.&nbsp; But it tells me
too, that those who, professing to be educated men, and therefore bound
to know better, treat these physical phenomena as spiritual, healthy,
and praiseworthy; who even exasperate them, that they may make capital
out of the weaknesses of fallen man, are the most contemptible and yet
the most dangerous of public enemies, let them cloak their quackery
under whatsoever patriotic, or scientific, or even sacred words.</p>
<p>There are those again honest, kindly, sensible, practical men, many
of them; men whom I have no wish to offend; whom I had rather ask to
teach me some of their own experience and common sense, which has learned
to discern, like good statesmen, not only what ought to be done, but
what can be done&mdash;there are those, I say, who would sooner see
this whole question let alone.&nbsp; Their feeling, as far as I can
analyse it, seems to be, that the evils of which I have been complaining,
are on the whole inevitable: or, if not, that we can mend so very little
of them, that it is wisest to leave them alone altogether, lest, like
certain sewers, &ldquo;the more you stir them, the more they smell.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They fear lest we should unsettle the minds of the many for whom these
evils will never be mended; lest we make them discontented; discontented
with their houses, their occupations, their food, their whole social
arrangements; and all in vain.</p>
<p>I should answer, in all courtesy and humility&mdash;for I sympathise
deeply with such men and women, and respect them deeply likewise&mdash;But
are not people discontented already, from the lowest to the highest?&nbsp;
And ought a man, in such a piecemeal, foolish, greedy, sinful world
as this is, and always has been, to be anything but discontented?&nbsp;
If he thinks that things are going all right, must he not have a most
beggarly conception of what going right means?&nbsp; And if things are
not going right, can it be anything but good for him to see that they
are not going right?&nbsp; Can truth and fact harm any human being?&nbsp;
I shall not believe so, as long as I have a Bible wherein to believe.&nbsp;
For my part, I should like to make every man, woman, and child whom
I meet discontented with themselves, even as I am discontented with
myself.&nbsp; I should like to awaken in them, about their physical,
their intellectual, their moral condition, that divine discontent which
is the parent, first of upward aspiration and then of self-control,
thought, effort to fulfil that aspiration even in part.&nbsp; For to
be discontented with the divine discontent, and to be ashamed with the
noble shame, is the very germ and first upgrowth of all virtue.&nbsp;
Men begin at first, as boys begin when they grumble at their school
and their schoolmasters, to lay the blame on others; to be discontented
with their circumstances&mdash;the things which stand around them; and
to cry, &ldquo;Oh that I had this!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that I had
that!&rdquo;&nbsp; But that way no deliverance lies.&nbsp; That discontent
only ends in revolt and rebellion, social or political; and that, again,
still in the same worship of circumstances&mdash;but this time desperate&mdash;which
ends, let it disguise itself under what fine names it will, in what
the old Greeks called a tyranny; in which&mdash;as in the Spanish republics
of America, and in France more than once&mdash;all have become the voluntary
slaves of one man, because each man fancies that the one man can improve
his circumstances for him.</p>
<p>But the wise man will learn, like Epictetus the heroic slave, the
slave of Epaphroditus, Nero&rsquo;s minion&mdash;and in what baser and
uglier circumstances could human being find himself?&mdash;to find out
the secret of being truly free; namely, to be discontented with no man
and no thing save himself.&nbsp; To say not&mdash;&ldquo;Oh that I had
this and that!&rdquo; but &ldquo;Oh that I were this and that!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, by God&rsquo;s help&mdash;and that heroic slave, heathen though
he was, believed and trusted in God&rsquo;s help&mdash;&ldquo;I will
make myself that which God has shown me that I ought to be and can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand a-year, or ten million a-year, as Epictetus saw full
well, cannot mend that vulgar discontent with circumstances, which he
had felt&mdash;and who with more right?&mdash;and conquered, and despised.&nbsp;
For that is the discontent of children, wanting always more holidays
and more sweets.&nbsp; But I wish my readers to have, and to cherish,
the discontent of men and women.</p>
<p>Therefore I would make men and women discontented, with the divine
and wholesome discontent, at their own physical frame, and at that of
their children.&nbsp; I would accustom their eyes to those precious
heirlooms of the human race, the statues of the old Greeks; to their
tender grandeur, their chaste healthfulness, their unconscious, because
perfect, might: and say&mdash;There; these are tokens to you, and to
all generations yet unborn, of what man could be once; of what he can
be again if he will obey those laws of nature which are the voice of
God.&nbsp; I would make them discontented with the ugliness and closeness
of their dwellings; I would make the men discontented with the fashion
of their garments, and still more just now the women, of all ranks,
with the fashion of theirs; and with everything around them which they
have the power of improving, if it be at all ungraceful, superfluous,
tawdry, ridiculous, unwholesome.&nbsp; I would make them discontented
with what they call their education, and say to them&mdash;You call
the three Royal R&rsquo;s education?&nbsp; They are not education: no
more is the knowledge which would enable you to take the highest prizes
given by the Society of Arts, or any other body.&nbsp; They are not
education: they are only instruction; a necessary groundwork, in an
age like this, for making practical use of your education: but not the
education itself.</p>
<p>And if they asked me, What then education meant? I should point them,
first, I think, to noble old Lilly&rsquo;s noble old &lsquo;Euphues,&rsquo;
of three hundred years ago, and ask them to consider what it says about
education, and especially this passage concerning that mere knowledge
which is now-a-days strangely miscalled education.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are two principal and peculiar gifts in the nature of man, knowledge
and reason.&nbsp; The one&rdquo;&mdash;that is reason&mdash;&ldquo;commandeth,
and the other&rdquo;&mdash;that is knowledge&mdash;&ldquo;obeyeth.&nbsp;
These things neither the whirling wheel of fortune can change, nor the
deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate, neither sickness abate,
nor age abolish.&rdquo;&nbsp; And next I should point them to those
pages in Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s &lsquo;Juventus Mundi,&rsquo; where he
describes the ideal training of a Greek youth in Homer&rsquo;s days;
and say,&mdash;There: that is an education fit for a really civilised
man, even though he never saw a book in his life; the full, proportionate,
harmonious educing&mdash;that is, bringing out and developing&mdash;of
all the faculties of his body, mind, and heart, till he becomes at once
a reverent yet a self-assured, a graceful and yet a valiant, an able
and yet an eloquent personage.</p>
<p>And if any should say to me&mdash;&ldquo;But what has this to do
with science?&nbsp; Homer&rsquo;s Greeks knew no science;&rdquo; I should
rejoin&mdash;But they had, pre-eminently above all ancient races which
we know, the scientific instinct; the teachableness and modesty; the
clear eye and quick ear; the hearty reverence for fact and nature, and
for the human body, and mind, and spirit; for human nature, in a word,
in its completeness, as the highest fact upon this earth.&nbsp; Therefore
they became in after years, not only the great colonisers and the great
civilisers of the old world&mdash;the most practical people, I hold,
which the world ever saw; but the parents of all sound physics as well
as of all sound metaphysics.&nbsp; Their very religion, in spite of
its imperfections, helped forward their education, not in spite of,
but by means of, that anthropomorphism which we sometimes too hastily
decry.&nbsp; As Mr. Gladstone says in a passage which I must quote at
length&mdash;&ldquo;As regarded all other functions of our nature, outside
the domain of the life to Godward&mdash;all those functions which are
summed up in what St. Paul calls the flesh and the mind, the psychic
and bodily life, the tendency of the system was to exalt the human element,
by proposing a model of beauty, strength, and wisdom, in all their combinations,
so elevated that the effort to attain them required a continual upward
strain.&nbsp; It made divinity attainable; and thus it effectually directed
the thought and aim of man</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Along the line of limitless desires.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a scheme of religion, though failing grossly in the government
of the passions, and in upholding the standard of moral duties, tended
powerfully to produce a lofty self-respect, and a large, free, and varied
conception of humanity.&nbsp; It incorporated itself in schemes of notable
discipline for mind and body, indeed of a lifelong education; and these
habits of mind and action had their marked results (to omit many other
greatnesses) in a philosophy, literature, and art, which remain to this
day unrivalled or unsurpassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much those old Greeks did for their own education, without science
and without Christianity.&nbsp; We who have both: what might we not
do, if we would be true to our advantages, and to ourselves?</p>
<h2>THE TWO BREATHS.&nbsp; A LECTURE DELIVERED AT WINCHESTER, MAY 31,
1869.</h2>
<p>Ladies,&mdash;I have been honoured by a second invitation to address
you here, from the lady to whose public spirit the establishment of
these lectures is due.&nbsp; I dare not refuse it: because it gives
me an opportunity of speaking on a matter, knowledge and ignorance about
which may seriously affect your health and happiness, and that of the
children with whom you may have to do.&nbsp; I must apologize if I say
many things which are well known to many persons in this room: they
ought to be well known to all; and it is generally best to assume total
ignorance in one&rsquo;s hearers, and to begin from the beginning.</p>
<p>I shall try to be as simple as possible; to trouble you as little
as possible with scientific terms; to be practical; and at the same
time, if possible, interesting.</p>
<p>I should wish to call this lecture &ldquo;The Two Breaths:&rdquo;
not merely &ldquo;The Breath;&rdquo; and for this reason: every time
you breathe, you breathe two different breaths; you take in one, you
give out another.&nbsp; The composition of those two breaths is different.&nbsp;
Their effects are different.&nbsp; The breath which has been breathed
out must not be breathed in again.&nbsp; To tell you why it must not
would lead me into anatomical details, not quite in place here as yet:
though the day will come, I trust, when every woman entrusted with the
care of children will be expected to know something about them.&nbsp;
But this I may say&mdash;Those who habitually take in fresh breath will
probably grow up large, strong, ruddy, cheerful, active, clear-headed,
fit for their work.&nbsp; Those who habitually take in the breath which
has been breathed out by themselves, or any other living creature, will
certainly grow up, if they grow up at all, small, weak, pale, nervous,
depressed, unfit for work, and tempted continually to resort to stimulants,
and become drunkards.</p>
<p>If you want to see how different the breath breathed out is from
the breath taken in, you have only to try a somewhat cruel experiment,
but one which people too often try upon themselves, their children,
and their work-people.&nbsp; If you take any small animal with lungs
like your own&mdash;a mouse, for instance&mdash;and force it to breathe
no air but what you have breathed already; if you put it in a close
box, and while you take in breath from the outer air, send out your
breath through a tube, into that box, the animal will soon faint; if
you go on long with this process, it will die.</p>
<p>Take a second instance, which I beg to press most seriously on the
notice of mothers, governesses, and nurses: If you allow a child to
get into the habit of sleeping with its head under the bed-clothes,
and thereby breathing its own breath over and over again, that child
will assuredly grow pale, weak, and ill.&nbsp; Medical men have cases
on record of scrofula appearing in children previously healthy, which
could only be accounted for from this habit, and which ceased when the
habit stopped.&nbsp; Let me again entreat your attention to this undoubted
fact.</p>
<p>Take another instance, which is only too common: If you are in a
crowded room, with plenty of fire and lights and company, doors and
windows all shut tight, how often you feel faint&mdash;so faint, that
you may require smelling-salts or some other stimulant.&nbsp; The cause
of your faintness is just the same as that of the mouse&rsquo;s fainting
in the box: you and your friends, and, as I shall show you presently,
the fire and the candles likewise, having been all breathing each other&rsquo;s
breaths, over and over again, till the air has become unfit to support
life.&nbsp; You are doing your best to enact over again the Highland
tragedy, of which Sir James Simpson tells in his lectures to the working-classes
of Edinburgh, when at a Christmas meeting thirty-six persons danced
all night in a small room with a low ceiling, keeping the doors and
windows shut.&nbsp; The atmosphere of the room was noxious beyond description;
and the effect was, that seven of the party were soon after seized with
typhus fever, of which two died.&nbsp; You are inflicting on yourselves
the torments of the poor dog, who is kept at the Grotto del Cane, near
Naples, to be stupified, for the amusement of visitors, by the carbonic
acid gas of the Grotto, and brought to life again by being dragged into
the fresh air; nay, you are inflicting upon yourselves the torments
of the famous Black Hole of Calcutta; and, if there was no chimney in
the room, by which some fresh air could enter, the candles would soon
burn blue&mdash;as they do, you know, when ghosts appear; your brains
become disturbed; and you yourselves run the risk of becoming ghosts,
and the candles of actually going out.</p>
<p>Of this last fact there is no doubt; for if, instead of putting a
mouse into the box, you will put a lighted candle, and breathe into
the tube, as before, however gently, you will in a short time put the
candle out.</p>
<p>Now, how is this?&nbsp; First, what is the difference between the
breath you take in and the breath you give out?&nbsp; And next, why
has it a similar effect on animal life and a lighted candle?</p>
<p>The difference is this.&nbsp; The breath which you take in is, or
ought to be, pure air, composed, on the whole, of oxygen and nitrogen,
with a minute portion of carbonic acid.</p>
<p>The breath which you give out is an impure air, to which has been
added, among other matters which will not support life, an excess of
carbonic acid.</p>
<p>That this is the fact you can prove for yourselves by a simple experiment.&nbsp;
Get a little lime water at the chemist&rsquo;s, and breathe into it
through a glass tube; your breath will at once make the lime-water milky.&nbsp;
The carbonic acid of your breath has laid hold of the lime, and made
it visible as white carbonate of lime&mdash;in plain English, as common
chalk.</p>
<p>Now, I do not wish, as I said, to load your memories with scientific
terms: but I beseech you to remember at least these two&mdash;oxygen
gas and carbonic acid gas; and to remember that, as surely as oxygen
feeds the fire of life, so surely does carbonic acid put it out.</p>
<p>I say, &ldquo;the fire of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that expression lies
the answer to our second question: Why does our breath produce a similar
effect upon the mouse and the lighted candle?&nbsp; Every one of us
is, as it were, a living fire.&nbsp; Were we not, how could we be always
warmer than the air outside us?&nbsp; There is a process going on perpetually
in each of us, similar to that by which coals are burnt in the fire,
oil in a lamp, wax in a candle, and the earth itself in a volcano.&nbsp;
To keep each of those fires alight, oxygen is needed; and the products
of combustion, as they are called, are more or less the same in each
case&mdash;carbonic acid and steam.</p>
<p>These facts justify the expression I just made use of&mdash;which
may have seemed to some of you fantastical&mdash;that the fire and the
candles in the crowded room were breathing the same breath as you were.&nbsp;
It is but too true.&nbsp; An average fire in the grate requires, to
keep it burning, as much oxygen as several human beings do; each candle
or lamp must have its share of oxygen likewise, and that a very considerable
one; and an average gas-burner&mdash;pray attend to this, you who live
in rooms lighted with gas&mdash;consumes as much oxygen as several candles.&nbsp;
All alike are making carbonic acid.&nbsp; The carbonic acid of the fire
happily escapes up the chimney in the smoke: but the carbonic acid from
the human beings and the candles remains to poison the room, unless
it be ventilated.</p>
<p>Now, I think you may understand one of the simplest, and yet most
terrible, cases of want of ventilation&mdash;death by the fumes of charcoal.&nbsp;
A human being shut up in a room, of which every crack is closed, with
a pan of burning charcoal, falls asleep, never to wake again.&nbsp;
His inward fire is competing with the fire of the charcoal for the oxygen
of the room; both are making carbonic acid out of it: but the charcoal,
being the stronger of the two, gets all the oxygen to itself, and leaves
the human being nothing to inhale but the carbonic acid which it has
made.&nbsp; The human being, being the weaker, dies first: but the charcoal
dies also.&nbsp; When it has exhausted all the oxygen of the room, it
cools, goes out, and is found in the morning half-consumed beside its
victim.&nbsp; If you put a giant or an elephant, I should conceive,
into that room, instead of a human being, the case would be reversed
for a time: the elephant would put out the burning charcoal by the carbonic
acid from his mighty lungs; and then, when he had exhausted all the
air in the room, die likewise of his own carbonic acid.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Now, I think, we may see what ventilation means, and why it is needed.</p>
<p>Ventilation means simply letting out the foul air, and letting in
the fresh air; letting out the air which has been breathed by men or
by candles, and letting in the air which has not.&nbsp; To understand
how to do that, we must remember a most simple chemical law, that a
gas as it is warmed expands, and therefore becomes lighter; as it cools,
it contracts, and becomes heavier.</p>
<p>Now the carbonic acid in the breath which comes out of our mouth
is warm, lighter than the air, and rises to the ceiling; and therefore
in any unventilated room full of people, there is a layer of foul air
along the ceiling.&nbsp; You might soon test that for yourselves, if
you could mount a ladder and put your heads there aloft.&nbsp; You do
test it for yourselves when you sit in the galleries of churches and
theatres, where the air is palpably more foul, and therefore more injurious,
than down below.</p>
<p>Where, again, work-people are employed in a crowded house of many
storeys, the health of those who work on the upper floors always suffers
most.</p>
<p>In the old monkey-house of the Zoological Gardens, when the cages
were on the old plan, tier upon tier, the poor little fellows in the
uppermost tier&mdash;so I have been told&mdash;always died first of
the monkey&rsquo;s constitutional complaint, consumption, simply from
breathing the warm breath of their friends below.&nbsp; But since the
cages have been altered, and made to range side by side from top to
bottom, consumption&mdash;I understand&mdash;has vastly diminished among
them.</p>
<p>The first question in ventilation, therefore, is to get this carbonic
acid safe out of the room, while it is warm and light and close to the
ceiling; for if you do not, this happens&mdash;The carbonic acid gas
cools and becomes heavier; for carbonic acid, at the same temperature
as common air, is so much heavier than common air, that you may actually&mdash;if
you are handy enough&mdash;turn it from one vessel to another, and pour
out for your enemy a glass of invisible poison.&nbsp; So down to the
floor this heavy carbonic acid comes, and lies along it, just as it
lies often in the bottom of old wells, or old brewers&rsquo; vats, as
a stratum of poison, killing occasionally the men who descend into it.&nbsp;
Hence, as foolish a practice as I know is that of sleeping on the floor;
for towards the small hours, when the room gets cold, the sleeper on
the floor is breathing carbonic acid.</p>
<p>And here one word to those ladies who interest themselves with the
poor.&nbsp; The poor are too apt in times of distress to pawn their
bedsteads and keep their beds.&nbsp; Never, if you have influence, let
that happen.&nbsp; Keep the bedstead, whatever else may go, to save
the sleeper from the carbonic acid on the floor.</p>
<p>How, then, shall we get rid of the foul air at the top of the room?&nbsp;
After all that has been written and tried on ventilation, I know no
simpler method than putting into the chimney one of Arnott&rsquo;s ventilators,
which may be bought and fixed for a few shillings; always remembering
that it must be fixed into the chimney as near the ceiling as possible.&nbsp;
I can speak of these ventilators from twenty-five years&rsquo; experience.&nbsp;
Living in a house with low ceilings, liable to become overcharged with
carbonic acid, which produces sleepiness in the evening, I have found
that these ventilators keep the air fresh and pure; and I consider the
presence of one of these ventilators in a room more valuable than three
or four feet additional height of ceiling.&nbsp; I have found, too,
that their working proves how necessary they are, from this simple fact:&mdash;You
would suppose that, as the ventilator opens freely into the chimney,
the smoke would be blown down through it in high winds, and blacken
the ceiling: but this is just what does not happen.&nbsp; If the ventilator
be at all properly poised, so as to shut with a violent gust of wind,
it will at all other moments keep itself permanently open; proving thereby
that there is an up-draught of heated air continually escaping from
the ceiling up the chimney.&nbsp; Another very simple method of ventilation
is employed in those excellent cottages which Her Majesty has built
for her labourers round Windsor.&nbsp; Over each door a sheet of perforated
zinc, some 18 inches square, is fixed; allowing the foul air to escape
into the passage; and in the ceiling of the passage a similar sheet
of zinc, allowing it to escape into the roof.&nbsp; Fresh air, meanwhile,
should be obtained from outside, by piercing the windows, or otherwise.&nbsp;
And here let me give one hint to all builders of houses.&nbsp; If possible,
let bedroom windows open at the top as well as at the bottom.</p>
<p>Let me impress the necessity of using some such contrivances, not
only on parents and educators, but on those who employ work-people,
and above all on those who employ young women in shops or in work-rooms.&nbsp;
What their condition may be in this city I know not; but most painful
it has been to me in other places, when passing through warehouses or
work-rooms, to see the pale, sodden, and, as the French would say &ldquo;etiolated&rdquo;
countenances of the girls who were passing the greater part of the day
in them; and painful, also, to breathe an atmosphere of which habit
had, alas! made them unconscious, but which to one coming out of the
open air was altogether noxious, and shocking also; for it was fostering
the seeds of death, not only in the present but in future generations.</p>
<p>Why should this be?&nbsp; Every one will agree that good ventilation
is necessary in a hospital, because people cannot get well without fresh
air.&nbsp; Do they not see that by the same reasoning good ventilation
is necessary everywhere, because people cannot remain well without fresh
air?&nbsp; Let me entreat those who employ women in work-rooms, if they
have no time to read through such books as Dr. Andrew Combe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Physiology applied to Health and Education,&rsquo; and Madame
de Wahl&rsquo;s &lsquo;Practical Hints on the Moral, Mental, and Physical
Training of Girls,&rsquo; to procure certain tracts published by Messrs.
Jarrold, Paternoster Row, for the Ladies&rsquo; Sanitary Association;
especially one which bears on this subject, &lsquo;The Black-Hole in
our own Bedrooms;&rsquo; Dr. Lankester&rsquo;s &lsquo;School Manual
of Health;&rsquo; or a manual on ventilation, published by the Metropolitan
Working Classes Association for the Improvement of Public Health.</p>
<p>I look forward&mdash;I say it openly&mdash;to some period of higher
civilisation, when the Acts of Parliament for the ventilation of factories
and workshops shall be largely extended, and made far more stringent;
when officers of public health shall be empowered to enforce the ventilation
of every room in which persons are employed for hire; and empowered
also to demand a proper system of ventilation for every new house, whether
in country or in town.&nbsp; To that, I believe, we must come: but I
had sooner far see these improvements carried out, as befits the citizens
of a free country, in the spirit of the Gospel rather than in that of
the Law; carried out, not compulsorily and from fear of fines, but voluntarily,
from a sense of duty, honour, and humanity.&nbsp; I appeal, therefore,
to the good feeling of all whom it may concern, whether the health of
those whom they employ, and therefore the supply of fresh air which
they absolutely need, are not matters for which they are not, more or
less, responsible to their country and their God.</p>
<p>And if any excellent person of the old school should answer me&mdash;&ldquo;Why
make all this fuss about ventilation?&nbsp; Our forefathers got on very
well without it&rdquo;&mdash;I must answer that, begging their pardons,
our ancestors did nothing of the kind.&nbsp; Our ancestors got on usually
very ill in these matters: and when they got on well, it was because
they had good ventilation in spite of themselves.</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; They got on very ill.&nbsp; To quote a few remarkable
instances of longevity, or to tell me that men were larger and stronger
on the average in old times, is to yield to the old fallacy of fancying
that savages were peculiarly healthy, because those who were seen were
active and strong.&nbsp; The simple answer is, that the strong alone
survived, while the majority died from the severity of the training.&nbsp;
Savages do not increase in number; and our ancestors increased but very
slowly for many centuries.&nbsp; I am not going to disgust my audience
with statistics of disease: but knowing something, as I happen to do,
of the social state and of the health of the Middle and Elizabethan
Ages, I have no hesitation in saying that the average of disease and
death was far greater then than it is now.&nbsp; Epidemics of many kinds,
typhus, ague, plague&mdash;all diseases which were caused more or less
by bad air&mdash;devastated this land and Europe in those days with
a horrible intensity, to which even the choleras of our times are mild.&nbsp;
The back streets, the hospitals, the gaols, the barracks, the camps&mdash;every
place in which any large number of persons congregated, were so many
nests of pestilence, engendered by uncleanliness, which denied alike
the water which was drunk and the air which was breathed; and as a single
fact, of which the tables of insurance companies assure us, the average
of human life in England has increased twenty-five per cent. since the
reign of George I., owing simply to our more rational and cleanly habits
of life.</p>
<p>But secondly, I said that when our ancestors got on well, they did
so because they got ventilation in spite of themselves.&nbsp; Luckily
for them, their houses were ill-built; their doors and windows would
not shut.&nbsp; They had lattice-windowed houses, too; to live in one
of which, as I can testify from long experience, is as thoroughly ventilating
as living in a lantern with the horn broken out.&nbsp; It was because
their houses were full of draughts, and still more, in the early middle
age, because they had no glass, and stopped out the air only by a shutter
at night, that they sought for shelter rather than for fresh air, of
which they sometimes had too much; and, to escape the wind, built their
houses in holes, such as that in which the old city of Winchester stands.&nbsp;
Shelter, I believe, as much as the desire to be near fish in Lent, and
to occupy the rich alluvium of the valleys, made the monks of Old England
choose the river-banks for the sites of their abbeys.&nbsp; They made
a mistake therein, which, like most mistakes, did not go unpunished.&nbsp;
These low situations, especially while the forests were yet thick on
the hills around, were the perennial haunts of fever and ague, produced
by subtle vegetable poisons, carried in the carbonic acid given off
by rotting vegetation.&nbsp; So there, again, they fell in with man&rsquo;s
old enemy&mdash;bad air.</p>
<p>Still, as long as the doors and windows did not shut, some free circulation
of air remained.&nbsp; But now, our doors and windows shut only too
tight.&nbsp; We have plate-glass instead of lattices; and we have replaced
the draughty and smoky, but really wholesome open chimney, with its
wide corners and settles, by narrow registers, and even by stoves.&nbsp;
We have done all we can, in fact, to seal ourselves up hermetically
from the outer air, and to breathe our own breaths over and over again;
and we pay the penalty of it in a thousand ways unknown to our ancestors,
through whose rooms all the winds of heaven whistled, and who were glad
enough to shelter themselves from draughts in the sitting-room by the
high screen round the fire, and in the sleeping-room by the thick curtains
of the four-post bedstead, which is now rapidly disappearing before
a higher civilisation.&nbsp; We therefore absolutely require to make
for ourselves the very ventilation from which our ancestors tried to
escape.</p>
<p>But, ladies, there is an old and true proverb, that you may bring
a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink.&nbsp; And in like
wise it is too true, that you may bring people to the fresh air, but
you cannot make them breathe it.&nbsp; Their own folly, or the folly
of their parents and educators, prevents their lungs being duly filled
and duly emptied.&nbsp; Therefore, the blood is not duly oxygenated,
and the whole system goes wrong.</p>
<p>Paleness, weakness, consumption, scrofula, and too many other ailments,
are the consequences of ill-filled lungs.&nbsp; For without well-filled
lungs, robust health is impossible.</p>
<p>And if any one shall answer&mdash;&ldquo;We do not want robust health
so much as intellectual attainment.&nbsp; The mortal body, being the
lower organ, must take its chance, and be even sacrificed, if need be,
to the higher organ&mdash;the immortal mind:&rdquo;&mdash;To such I
reply, You cannot do it.&nbsp; The laws of nature, which are the express
will of God, laugh such attempts to scorn.&nbsp; Every organ of the
body is formed out of the blood; and if the blood be vitiated, every
organ suffers in proportion to its delicacy; and the brain, being the
most delicate and highly specialised of all organs, suffers most of
all and soonest of all, as every one knows who has tried to work his
brain when his digestion was the least out of order.&nbsp; Nay, the
very morals will suffer.&nbsp; From ill-filled lungs, which signify
ill-repaired blood, arise year by year an amount not merely of disease,
but of folly, temper, laziness, intemperance, madness, and, let me tell
you fairly, crime&mdash;the sum of which will never be known till that
great day when men shall be called to account for all deeds done in
the body, whether they be good or evil.</p>
<p>I must refer you on this subject again to Andrew Combe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Physiology,&rsquo;
especially chapters iv. and vii.; and also to chapter x. of Madame de
Wahl&rsquo;s excellent book.&nbsp; I will only say this shortly, that
the three most common causes of ill-filled lungs, in children and in
young ladies, are stillness, silence, and stays.</p>
<p>First, stillness; a sedentary life, and want of exercise.&nbsp; A
girl is kept for hours sitting on a form writing or reading, to do which
she must lean forward; and if her schoolmistress cruelly attempts to
make her sit upright, and thereby keep the spine in an attitude for
which Nature did not intend it, she is thereby doing her best to bring
on that disease, so fearfully common in girls&rsquo; schools, lateral
curvature of the spine.&nbsp; But practically the girl will stoop forward.&nbsp;
And what happens?&nbsp; The lower ribs are pressed into the body, thereby
displacing more or less something inside.&nbsp; The diaphragm in the
meantime, which is the very bellows of the lungs, remains loose; the
lungs are never properly filled or emptied; and an excess of carbonic
acid accumulates at the bottom of them.&nbsp; What follows?&nbsp; Frequent
sighing to get rid of it; heaviness of head; depression of the whole
nervous system under the influence of the poison of the lungs; and when
the poor child gets up from her weary work, what is the first thing
she probably does?&nbsp; She lifts up her chest, stretches, yawns, and
breathes deeply&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s voice, Nature&rsquo;s instinctive
cure, which is probably regarded as ungraceful, as what is called &ldquo;lolling&rdquo;
is.&nbsp; As if sitting upright was not an attitude in itself essentially
ungraceful, and such as no artist would care to draw.&nbsp; As if &ldquo;lolling,&rdquo;
which means putting the body in the attitude of the most perfect ease
compatible with a fully expanded chest, was not in itself essentially
graceful, and to be seen in every reposing figure in Greek bas-reliefs
and vases; graceful, and like all graceful actions, healthful at the
same time.&nbsp; The only tolerably wholesome attitude of repose, which
I see allowed in average school-rooms, is lying on the back on the floor,
or on a sloping board, in which case the lungs must be fully expanded.&nbsp;
But even so, a pillow, or some equivalent, ought to be placed under
the small of the back: or the spine will be strained at its very weakest
point.</p>
<p>I now go on to the second mistake&mdash;enforced silence.&nbsp; Moderate
reading aloud is good: but where there is any tendency to irritability
of throat or lungs, too much moderation cannot be used.&nbsp; You may
as well try to cure a diseased lung by working it, as to cure a lame
horse by galloping him.&nbsp; But where the breathing organs are of
average health, let it be said once and for all, that children and young
people cannot make too much noise.&nbsp; The parents who cannot bear
the noise of their children have no right to have brought them into
the world.&nbsp; The schoolmistress who enforces silence on her pupils
is committing&mdash;unintentionally no doubt, but still committing&mdash;an
offence against reason, worthy only of a convent.&nbsp; Every shout,
every burst of laughter, every song&mdash;nay, in the case of infants,
as physiologists well know, every moderate fit of crying&mdash;conduces
to health, by rapidly filling and emptying the lung, and changing the
blood more rapidly from black to red, that is, from death to life.&nbsp;
Andrew Combe tells a story of a large charity school, in which the young
girls were, for the sake of their health, shut up in the hall and school-room
during play hours, from November till March, and no romping or noise
allowed.&nbsp; The natural consequences were, the great majority of
them fell ill; and I am afraid that a great deal of illness has been
from time to time contracted in certain school-rooms, simply through
this one cause of enforced silence.&nbsp; Some cause or other there
must be for the amount of ill-health and weakliness which prevails especially
among girls of the middle classes in towns, who have not, poor things,
the opportunities which richer girls have, of keeping themselves in
strong health by riding, skating, archery&mdash;that last quite an admirable
exercise for the chest and lungs, and far preferable to croquet, which
involves too much unwholesome stooping.&mdash;Even playing at ball,
if milliners and shop-girls had room to indulge in one after their sedentary
work, might bring fresh spirits to many a heart, and fresh colour to
many a cheek.&nbsp; I spoke just now of the Greeks.&nbsp; I suppose
you will all allow that the Greeks were, as far as we know, the most
beautiful race which the world ever saw.&nbsp; Every educated man knows
that they were also the cleverest of all races; and, next to his Bible,
thanks God for Greek literature.</p>
<p>Now, these people had made physical as well as intellectual education
a science as well as a study.&nbsp; Their women practised graceful,
and in some cases even athletic, exercises.&nbsp; They developed, by
a free and healthy life, those figures which remain everlasting and
unapproachable models of human beauty: but&mdash;to come to my third
point&mdash;they wore no stays.&nbsp; The first mention of stays that
I have ever found is in the letters of dear old Synesius, Bishop of
Cyrene, on the Greek coast of Africa, about four hundred years after
the Christian era.&nbsp; He tells us how, when he was shipwrecked on
a remote part of the coast, and he and the rest of the passengers were
starving on cockles and limpets, there was among them a slave girl out
of the far East, who had a pinched wasp-waist, such as you may see on
the old Hindoo sculptures, and such as you may see in any street in
a British town.&nbsp; And when the Greek ladies of the neighbourhood
found her out, they sent for her from house to house, to behold, with
astonishment and laughter, this new and prodigious waist, with which
it seemed to them it was impossible for a human being to breathe or
live; and they petted the poor girl, and fed her, as they might a dwarf
or a giantess, till she got quite fat and comfortable, while her owners
had not enough to eat.&nbsp; So strange and ridiculous seemed our present
fashion to the descendants of those who, centuries before, had imagined,
because they had seen living and moving, those glorious statues which
we pretend to admire, but refuse to imitate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a few centuries hence, when mankind has learnt
to fear God more, and therefore to obey more strictly those laws of
nature and of science which are the will of God&mdash;it seems to me,
I say, that in those days the present fashion of tight lacing will be
looked back upon as a contemptible and barbarous superstition, denoting
a very low level of civilisation in the peoples which have practised
it.&nbsp; That for generations past women should have been in the habit&mdash;not
to please men, who do not care about the matter as a point of beauty&mdash;but
simply to vie with each other in obedience to something called fashion&mdash;that
they should, I say, have been in the habit of deliberately crushing
that part of the body which should be specially left free, contracting
and displacing their lungs, their heart, and all the most vital and
important organs, and entailing thereby disease, not only on themselves
but on their children after them; that for forty years past physicians
should have been telling them of the folly of what they have been doing:
and that they should as yet, in the great majority of cases, not only
turn a deaf ear to all warnings, but actually deny the offence, of which
one glance of the physician or the sculptor, who know what shape the
human body ought to be, brings them in guilty: this, I say, is an instance
of&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;which deserves at once the lash,
not merely of the satirist, but of any theologian who really believes
that God made the physical universe.&nbsp; Let me, I pray you, appeal
to your common sense for a moment.&nbsp; When any one chooses a horse
or a dog, whether for strength, for speed, or for any other useful purpose,
the first thing almost to be looked at is the girth round the ribs;
the room for heart and lungs.&nbsp; Exactly in proportion to that will
be the animal&rsquo;s general healthiness, power of endurance, and value
in many other ways.&nbsp; If you will look at eminent lawyers and famous
orators, who have attained a healthy old age, you will see that in every
case they are men, like the late Lord Palmerston, and others whom I
could mention, of remarkable size, not merely in the upper, but in the
lower part of the chest; men who had, therefore, a peculiar power of
using the diaphragm to fill and to clear the lungs, and therefore to
oxygenate the blood of the whole body.&nbsp; Now, it is just these lower
ribs, across which the diaphragm is stretched like the head of a drum,
which stays contract to a minimum.&nbsp; If you advised owners of horses
and hounds to put their horses or their hounds into stays, and lace
them up tight, in order to increase their beauty, you would receive,
I doubt not, a very courteous, but certainly a very decided, refusal
to do that which would spoil not merely the animals themselves, but
the whole stud or the whole kennel for years to come.&nbsp; And if you
advised an orator to put himself into tight stays, he, no doubt, again
would give a courteous answer; but he would reply&mdash;if he was a
really educated man&mdash;that to comply with your request would involve
his giving up public work, under the probable penalty of being dead
within the twelvemonth.</p>
<p>And how much work of every kind, intellectual as well as physical,
is spoiled or hindered; how many deaths occur from consumption and other
complaints which are the result of this habit of tight lacing, is known
partly to the medical men, who lift up their voices in vain, and known
fully to Him who will not interfere with the least of His own physical
laws to save human beings from the consequences of their own wilful
folly.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;to end this lecture with more pleasing thoughts&mdash;What
becomes of this breath which passes from your lips?&nbsp; Is it merely
harmful; merely waste?&nbsp; God forbid!&nbsp; God has forbidden that
anything should be merely harmful or merely waste in this so wise and
well-made world.&nbsp; The carbonic acid which passes from your lips
at every breath&mdash;ay, even that which oozes from the volcano crater
when the eruption is past&mdash;is a precious boon to thousands of things
of which you have daily need.&nbsp; Indeed there is a sort of hint at
physical truth in the old fairy tale of the girl, from whose lips, as
she spoke, fell pearls and diamonds; for the carbonic acid of your breath
may help hereafter to make the pure carbonate of lime of a pearl, or
the still purer carbon of a diamond.&nbsp; Nay, it may go&mdash;in such
a world of transformations do we live&mdash;to make atoms of coal strata,
which shall lie buried for ages beneath deep seas, shall be upheaved
in continents which are yet unborn, and there be burnt for the use of
a future race of men, and resolved into their original elements.&nbsp;
Coal, wise men tell us, is on the whole breath and sunlight; the breath
of living creatures who have lived in the vast swamps and forests of
some prim&aelig;val world, and the sunlight which transmuted that breath
into the leaves and stems of trees, magically locked up for ages in
that black stone, to become, when it is burnt at last, light and carbonic
acid, as it was at first.&nbsp; For though you must not breathe your
breath again, you may at least eat your breath, if you will allow the
sun to transmute it for you into vegetables; or you may enjoy its fragrance
and its colour in the shape of a lily or a rose.&nbsp; When you walk
in a sunlit garden, every word you speak, every breath you breathe,
is feeding the plants and flowers around.&nbsp; The delicate surface
of the green leaves absorbs the carbonic acid, and parts it into its
elements, retaining the carbon to make woody fibre, and courteously
returning you the oxygen to mingle with the fresh air, and be inhaled
by your lungs once more.&nbsp; Thus do you feed the plants; just as
the plants feed you; while the great life-giving sun feeds both; and
the geranium standing in the sick child&rsquo;s window does not merely
rejoice his eye and mind by its beauty and freshness, but repays honestly
the trouble spent on it; absorbing the breath which the child needs
not, and giving to him the breath which he needs.</p>
<p>So are the services of all things constituted according to a Divine
and wonderful order, and knit together in mutual dependence and mutual
helpfulness.&mdash;A fact to be remembered with hope and comfort; but
also with awe and fear.&nbsp; For as in that which is above nature,
so in nature itself; he that breaks one physical law is guilty of all.&nbsp;
The whole universe, as it were, takes up arms against him; and all nature,
with her numberless and unseen powers, is ready to avenge herself on
him, and on his children after him, he knows not when nor where.&nbsp;
He, on the other hand, who obeys the laws of nature with his whole heart
and mind, will find all things working together to him for good.&nbsp;
He is at peace with the physical universe.&nbsp; He is helped and befriended
alike by the sun above his head and the dust beneath his feet: because
he is obeying the will and mind of Him who made sun, and dust, and all
things; and who has given them a law which cannot be broken.</p>
<h2>THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.</h2>
<p>The more I have contemplated that ancient story of the Fall, the
more it has seemed to me within the range of probability, and even of
experience.&nbsp; It must have happened somewhere for the first time;
for it has happened only too many times since.&nbsp; It has happened,
as far as I can ascertain, in every race, and every age, and every grade
of civilisation.&nbsp; It is happening round us now in every region
of the globe.&nbsp; Always and everywhere, it seems to me, have poor
human beings been tempted to eat of some &ldquo;tree of knowledge,&rdquo;
that they may be, even for an hour, as gods; wise, but with a false
wisdom; careless, but with a frantic carelessness; and happy, but with
a happiness which, when the excitement is past, leaves too often&mdash;as
with that hapless pair in Eden&mdash;depression, shame, and fear.&nbsp;
Everywhere, and in all ages, as far as I can ascertain, has man been
inventing stimulants and narcotics to supply that want of vitality of
which he is so painfully aware; and has asked nature, and not God, to
clear the dull brain, and comfort the weary spirit.</p>
<p>This has been, and will be perhaps for many a century to come, almost
the most fearful failing of this poor, exceptional, over-organised,
diseased, and truly fallen being called man, who is in doubt daily whether
he be a god or an ape; and in trying wildly to become the former, ends
but too often in becoming the latter.</p>
<p>For man, whether savage or civilised, feels, and has felt in every
age, that there is something wrong with him.&nbsp; He usually confesses
this fact&mdash;as is to be expected&mdash;of his fellow-men, rather
than of himself; and shows his sense that there is something wrong with
them by complaining of, hating, and killing them.&nbsp; But he cannot
always conceal from himself the fact that he, too, is wrong, as well
as they; and as he will not usually kill himself, he tries wild ways
to make himself at least feel&mdash;if not to be&mdash;somewhat &ldquo;better.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Philosophers may bid him be content; and tell him that he is what he
ought to be, and what nature has made him.&nbsp; But he cares nothing
for the philosophers.&nbsp; He knows, usually, that he is not what he
ought to be; that he carries about with him, in most cases, a body more
or less diseased and decrepit, incapable of doing all the work which
he feels that he himself could do, or expressing all the emotions which
he himself longs to express; a dull brain and dull senses, which cramp
the eager infinity within him; as&mdash;so Goethe once said with pity&mdash;the
horse&rsquo;s single hoof cramps the fine intelligence and generosity
of his nature, and forbids him even to grasp an object, like the more
stupid cat, and baser monkey.&nbsp; And man has a self, too, within,
from which he longs too often to escape, as from a household ghost;
who pulls out, at unfortunately rude and unwelcome hours, the ledger
of memory.&nbsp; And so when the tempter&mdash;be he who he may&mdash;says
to him &ldquo;Take this, and you will &lsquo;feel better&rsquo;&mdash;Take
this, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil:&rdquo; then,
if the temptation was, as the old story says, too much for man while
healthy and unfallen, what must it be for his unhealthy and fallen children?&nbsp;
In vain we say to man&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis life, not death, for which you pant;<br />
&rsquo;Tis life, whereof your nerves are scant;<br />
More life, and fuller, that you want.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And your tree of knowledge is not the tree of life: it is, in every
case, the tree of death; of decrepitude, madness, misery.&nbsp; He prefers
the voice of the tempter&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt not surely die.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nay, he will say at last,&mdash;&ldquo;Better be as gods awhile, and
die: than be the crawling, insufficient thing I am; and live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&mdash;did I say?&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I must say she likewise.&nbsp;
The sacred story is only too true to fact, when it represents the woman
as falling, not merely at the same time as the man, but before the man.&nbsp;
Only let us remember that it represents the woman as tempted; tempted,
seemingly, by a rational being, of lower race, and yet of superior cunning;
who must, therefore, have fallen before the woman.&nbsp; Who or what
the being was, who is called the Serpent in our translation of Genesis,
it is not for me to say.&nbsp; We have absolutely, I think, no facts
from which to judge; and Rabbinical traditions need trouble no man much.&nbsp;
But I fancy that a missionary, preaching on this story to Negroes; telling
them plainly that the &ldquo;Serpent&rdquo; meant the first Obeah man;
and then comparing the experiences of that hapless pair in Eden, with
their own after certain orgies not yet extinct in Africa and elsewhere,
would be only too well understood: so well, indeed, that he might run
some risk of eating himself, not of the tree of life, but of that of
death.&nbsp; The sorcerer or sorceress tempting the woman; and then
the woman tempting the man; this seems to be, certainly among savage
peoples, and, alas! too often among civilised peoples also, the usual
course of the world-wide tragedy.</p>
<p>But&mdash;paradoxical as it may seem&mdash;the woman&rsquo;s yielding
before the man is not altogether to her dishonour, as those old monks
used to allege who hated, and too often tortured, the sex whom they
could not enjoy.&nbsp; It is not to the woman&rsquo;s dishonour, if
she felt, before her husband, higher aspirations than those after mere
animal pleasure.&nbsp; To be as gods, knowing good and evil, is a vain
and foolish, but not a base and brutal, wish.&nbsp; She proved herself
thereby&mdash;though at an awful cost&mdash;a woman, and not an animal.&nbsp;
And indeed the woman&rsquo;s more delicate organisation, her more vivid
emotions, her more voluble fancy, as well as her mere physical weakness
and weariness, have been to her, in all ages, a special source of temptation
which it is to her honour that she has resisted so much better than
the physically stronger, and therefore more culpable, man.</p>
<p>As for what the tree of knowledge was, there really is no need for
us to waste our time in guessing.&nbsp; If it was not one plant, then
it was another.&nbsp; It may have been something which has long since
perished off the earth.&nbsp; It may have been&mdash;as some learned
men have guessed&mdash;the sacred Soma, or Homa, of the early Brahmin
race; and that may have been a still existing narcotic species of Asclepias.&nbsp;
It certainly was not the vine.&nbsp; The language of the Hebrew Scripture
concerning it, and the sacred use to which it is consecrated in the
Gospels, forbid that notion utterly; at least to those who know enough
of antiquity to pass by, with a smile, the theory that the wines mentioned
in Scripture were not intoxicating.&nbsp; And yet&mdash;as a fresh corroboration
of what I am trying to say&mdash;how fearfully has that noble gift to
man been abused for the same end as a hundred other vegetable products,
ever since those mythic days when Dionusos brought the vine from the
far East, amid troops of human M&aelig;nads and half-human Satyrs; and
the Bacch&aelig; tore Pentheus in pieces on Cith&aelig;ron, for daring
to intrude upon their sacred rites; and since those historic days, too,
when, less than two hundred years before the Christian era, the Bacchic
rites spread from Southern Italy into Etruria, and thence to the matrons
of Rome; and under the guidance of P&oelig;nia Annia, a Campanian lady,
took at last shapes of which no man must speak, but which had to be
put down with terrible but just severity, by the Consuls and the Senate.</p>
<p>But it matters little, I say, what this same tree of knowledge was.&nbsp;
Was every vine on earth destroyed to-morrow, and every vegetable also
from which alcohol is now distilled, man would soon discover something
else wherewith to satisfy the insatiate craving.&nbsp; Has he not done
so already?&nbsp; Has not almost every people had its tree of knowledge,
often more deadly than any distilled liquor, from the absinthe of the
cultivated Frenchman, and the opium of the cultivated Chinese, down
to the bush-poisons wherewith the tropic sorcerer initiates his dupes
into the knowledge of good and evil, and the fungus from which the Samoiede
extracts in autumn a few days of brutal happiness, before the setting
in of the long six months&rsquo; night?&nbsp; God grant that modern
science may not bring to light fresh substitutes for alcohol, opium,
and the rest; and give the white races, in that state of effeminate
and godless quasi-civilisation which I sometimes fear is creeping upon
them, fresh means of destroying themselves delicately and pleasantly
off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>It is said by some that drunkenness is on the increase in this island.&nbsp;
I have no trusty proof of it: but I can believe it possible; for every
cause of drunkenness seems on the increase.&nbsp; Overwork of body and
mind; circumstances which depress health; temptation to drink, and drink
again, at every corner of the streets; and finally, money, and ever
more money, in the hands of uneducated people, who have not the desire,
and too often not the means, of spending it in any save the lowest pleasures.&nbsp;
These, it seems to me, are the true causes of drunkenness, increasing
or not.&nbsp; And if we wish to become a more temperate nation, we must
lessen them, if we cannot eradicate them.</p>
<p>First, overwork.&nbsp; We all live too fast, and work too hard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All things are full of labour, man cannot utter it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the heavy struggle for existence which goes on all around us, each
man is tasked more and more&mdash;if he be really worth buying and using&mdash;to
the utmost of his powers all day long.&nbsp; The weak have to compete
on equal terms with the strong; and crave, in consequence, for artificial
strength.&nbsp; How we shall stop that I know not, while every man is
&ldquo;making haste to be rich, and piercing himself through with many
sorrows, and falling into foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men
in destruction and perdition.&rdquo;&nbsp; How we shall stop that, I
say, I know not.&nbsp; The old prophet may have been right when he said,
&ldquo;Surely it is not of the Lord that the people shall labour in
the very fire, and weary themselves for very vanity;&rdquo; and in some
juster, wiser, more sober system of society&mdash;somewhat more like
the Kingdom of The Father come on earth&mdash;it may be that poor human
beings will not need to toil so hard, and to keep themselves up to their
work by stimulants, but will have time to sit down, and look around
them, and think of God, and of God&rsquo;s quiet universe, with something
of quiet in themselves; something of rational leisure, and manful sobriety
of mind, as well as of body.</p>
<p>But it seems to me also, that in such a state of society, when&mdash;as
it was once well put&mdash;&ldquo;every one has stopped running about
like rats:&rdquo;&mdash;that those who work hard, whether with muscle
or with brain, would not be surrounded, as now, with every circumstance
which tempts toward drink; by every circumstance which depresses the
vital energies, and leaves them an easy prey to pestilence itself; by
bad light, bad air, bad food, bad water, bad smells, bad occupations,
which weaken the muscles, cramp the chest, disorder the digestion.&nbsp;
Let any rational man, fresh from the country&mdash;in which I presume
God, having made it, meant all men, more or less, to live&mdash;go through
the back streets of any city, or through whole districts of the &ldquo;black
countries&rdquo; of England: and then ask himself&mdash;Is it the will
of God that His human children should live and toil in such dens, such
deserts, such dark places of the earth?&nbsp; Let him ask himself&mdash;Can
they live and toil there without contracting a probably diseased habit
of body; without contracting a certainly dull, weary, sordid habit of
mind, which craves for any pleasure, however brutal, to escape from
its own stupidity and emptiness?&nbsp; When I run through, by rail,
certain parts of the iron-producing country&mdash;streets of furnaces,
collieries, slag heaps, mud, slop, brick house-rows, smoke, dirt&mdash;and
that is all; and when I am told, whether truly or falsely, that the
main thing which the well-paid and well-fed men of those abominable
wastes care for is&mdash;good fighting-dogs: I can only answer, that
I am not surprised.</p>
<p>I say&mdash;as I have said elsewhere, and shall do my best to say
again&mdash;that the craving for drink and narcotics, especially that
engendered in our great cities, is not a disease, but a symptom of disease;
of a far deeper disease than any which drunkenness can produce; namely,
of the growing degeneracy of a population striving in vain by stimulants
and narcotics to fight against those slow poisons with which our greedy
barbarism, miscalled civilisation, has surrounded them from the cradle
to the grave.&nbsp; I may be answered that the old German, Angle, Dane,
drank heavily.&nbsp; I know it: but why did they drink, save for the
same reason that the fenman drank, and his wife took opium, at least
till the fens were drained? why but to keep off the depressing effects
of the malaria of swamps and new clearings, which told on them&mdash;who
always settled in the lowest grounds&mdash;in the shape of fever and
ague?&nbsp; Here it may be answered again, that stimulants have been,
during the memory of man, the destruction of the Red Indian race in
America.&nbsp; I reply boldly, that I do not believe it.&nbsp; There
is evidence enough in Jaques Cartier&rsquo;s &lsquo;Voyages to the Rivers
of Canada;&rsquo; and evidence more than enough in Strachey&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Travaile in Virginia&rsquo;&mdash;to quote only two authorities
out of many&mdash;to prove that the Red Indians, when the white man
first met with them, were, in North and South alike, a diseased, decaying,
and, as all their traditions confess, decreasing race.&nbsp; Such a
race would naturally crave for &ldquo;the water of life,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;usque-bagh,&rdquo; or whisky, as we have contracted the old name
now.&nbsp; But I should have thought that the white man, by introducing
among these poor creatures iron, fire-arms, blankets, and above all
horses wherewith to follow the buffalo-herds which they could never
follow on foot, must have done ten times more towards keeping them alive,
than he has done towards destroying them by giving them the chance of
a week&rsquo;s drunkenness twice a year, when they came in to his forts
to sell the skins which, without his gifts, they would never have got.</p>
<p>Such a race would, of course, if wanting vitality, crave for stimulants.&nbsp;
But if the stimulants, and not the original want of vitality, combined
with morals utterly detestable, and worthy only of the gallows&mdash;and
here I know what I say, and dare not tell what I know, from eye-witnesses&mdash;have
been the cause of the Red Indians&rsquo; extinction: then how is it,
let me ask, that the Irishman and the Scotsman have, often to their
great harm, been drinking as much whisky&mdash;and usually very bad
whisky&mdash;not merely twice a year, but as often as they could get
it, during the whole &ldquo;iron age;&rdquo; and, for aught any one
can tell, during the &ldquo;bronze age,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;stone
age&rdquo; before that: and yet are still the most healthy, able, valiant,
and prolific races in Europe?&nbsp; Had they drunk less whisky they
would, doubtless, have been more healthy, able, valiant, and perhaps
even more prolific, than they are now.&nbsp; They show no sign, however,
as yet, of going the way of the Red Indian.</p>
<p>But if the craving for stimulants and narcotics is a token of deficient
vitality: then the deadliest foe of that craving, and all its miserable
results, is surely the Sanatory Reformer; the man who preaches, and&mdash;as
far as ignorance and vested interests will allow him, procures&mdash;for
the masses, pure air, pure sunlight, pure water, pure dwelling-houses,
pure food.&nbsp; Not merely every fresh drinking-fountain: but every
fresh public bath and wash-house, every fresh open space, every fresh
growing tree, every fresh open window, every fresh flower in that window&mdash;each
of these is so much, as the old Persians would have said, conquered
for Ormuzd, the god of light and life, out of the dominion of Ahriman,
the king of darkness and of death; so much taken from the causes of
drunkenness and disease, and added to the causes of sobriety and health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile one thing is clear: that if this present barbarism and
anarchy of covetousness, miscalled modern civilisation, were tamed and
drilled into something more like a Kingdom of God on earth: then we
should not see the reckless and needless multiplication of liquor shops,
which disgraces this country now.</p>
<p>As a single instance: in one country parish of nine hundred inhabitants,
in which the population has increased only one-ninth in the last fifty
years, there are now practically eight public-houses, where fifty years
ago there were but two.&nbsp; One, that is, for every hundred and ten&mdash;or
rather, omitting children, farmers, shopkeepers, gentlemen, and their
households, one for every fifty of the inhabitants.&nbsp; In the face
of the allurements, often of the basest kind, which these dens offer,
the clergyman and the schoolmaster struggle in vain to keep up night-schools
and young men&rsquo;s clubs, and to inculcate habits of providence.</p>
<p>The young labourers over a great part of the south and east, at least,
of England,&mdash;though never so well off, for several generations,
as they are now&mdash;are growing up thriftless, shiftless; inferior,
it seems to me, to their grandfathers in everything, save that they
can usually read and write, and their grandfathers could not; and that
they wear smart cheap cloth clothes, instead of their grandfathers&rsquo;
smock-frocks.</p>
<p>And if it be so in the country: how must it be in towns?&nbsp; There
must come a thorough change in the present licensing system, in spite
of all the &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; which certain powerful vested interests
may bring to bear on governments.&nbsp; And it is the duty of every
good citizen, who cares for his countrymen, and for their children after
them, to help in bringing about that change as speedily as possible.</p>
<p>Again: I said just now that a probable cause of increasing drunkenness
was the increasing material prosperity of thousands who knew no recreation
beyond low animal pleasure.&nbsp; If I am right&mdash;and I believe
that I am right&mdash;I must urge on those who wish drunkenness to decrease,
the necessity of providing more, and more refined recreation for the
people.</p>
<p>Men drink, and women too, remember, not merely to supply exhaustion;
not merely to drive away care: but often simply to drive away dulness.&nbsp;
They have nothing to do save to think over what they have done in the
day, or what they expect to do to-morrow; and they escape from that
dreary round of business thought, in liquor or narcotics.&nbsp; There
are still those, by no means of the hand-working class, but absorbed
all day by business, who drink heavily at night in their own comfortable
homes, simply to recreate their overburdened minds.&nbsp; Such cases,
doubtless, are far less common than they were fifty years ago: but why?&nbsp;
Is not the decrease of drinking among the richer classes certainly due
to the increased refinement and variety of their tastes and occupations?&nbsp;
In cultivating the &aelig;sthetic side of man&rsquo;s nature; in engaging
him with the beautiful, the pure, the wonderful, the truly natural;
with painting, poetry, music, horticulture, physical science&mdash;in
all this lies recreation, in the true and literal sense of that word,
namely, the recreating and mending of the exhausted mind and feelings,
such as no rational man will now neglect, either for himself, his children,
or his work-people.</p>
<p>But how little of all this is open to the masses, all should know
but too well.&nbsp; How little opportunity the average hand-worker,
or his wife, has of eating of any tree of knowledge, save of the very
basest kind, is but too palpable.&nbsp; We are mending, thank God, in
this respect.&nbsp; Free libraries and museums have sprung up of late
in other cities beside London.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s blessing rest upon
them all.&nbsp; And the Crystal Palace, and still later, the Bethnal
Green Museum, have been, I believe, of far more use than many average
sermons and lectures from many average orators.</p>
<p>But are we not still far behind the old Greeks, and the Romans of
the Empire likewise, in the amount of amusement and instruction, and
even of shelter, which we provide for the people?&nbsp; Recollect the&mdash;to
me&mdash;disgraceful fact; that there is not, as far as I am aware,
throughout the whole of London, a single portico or other covered place,
in which the people can take refuge during a shower: and this in the
climate of England!&nbsp; Where they do take refuge on a wet day the
publican knows but too well; as he knows also where thousands of the
lower classes, simply for want of any other place to be in, save their
own sordid dwellings, spend as much as they are permitted of the Sabbath
day.&nbsp; Let us put down &ldquo;Sunday drinking&rdquo; by all means,
if we can.&nbsp; But let us remember that by closing the public-house
on Sunday, we prevent no man or woman from carrying home as much poison
as they choose on Saturday night, to brutalise themselves therewith,
perhaps for eight-and-forty hours.&nbsp; And let us see&mdash;in the
name of Him who said that He had made the Sabbath for man, and not man
for the Sabbath&mdash;let us see, I say, if we cannot do something to
prevent the townsman&rsquo;s Sabbath being, not a day of rest, but a
day of mere idleness; the day of most temptation, because of most dulness,
of the whole seven.</p>
<p>And here, perhaps, some sweet soul may look up reprovingly and say&mdash;He
talks of rest.&nbsp; Does he forget, and would he have the working man
forget, that all these outward palliatives will never touch the seat
of the disease, the unrest of the soul within?&nbsp; Does he forget,
and would he have the working man forget, who it was who said&mdash;who
only has the right to say&mdash;&ldquo;Come unto Me, all ye who are
weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest&rdquo;?&nbsp; Ah no,
sweet soul.&nbsp; I know your words are true.&nbsp; I know that what
we all want is inward rest; rest of heart and brain; the calm, strong,
self-contained, self-denying character; which needs no stimulants, for
it has no fits of depression; which needs no narcotics, for it has no
fits of excitement; which needs no ascetic restraints, for it is strong
enough to use God&rsquo;s gifts without abusing them; the character,
in a word, which is truly temperate, not in drink or food merely, but
in all desires, thoughts, and actions; freed from the wild lusts and
ambitions to which that old Adam yielded, and, seeking for light and
life by means forbidden, found thereby disease and death.&nbsp; Yes;
I know that; and know, too, that that rest is found, only where you
have already found it.</p>
<p>And yet: in such a world as this; governed by a Being who has made
sunshine, and flowers, and green grass, and the song of birds, and happy
human smiles; and who would educate by them&mdash;if we would let Him&mdash;His
human children from the cradle to the grave; in such a world as this,
will you grudge any particle of that education, even any harmless substitute
for it, to those spirits in prison, whose surroundings too often tempt
them, from the cradle to the grave, to fancy that the world is composed
of bricks and iron, and governed by inspectors and policemen?&nbsp;
Preach to those spirits in prison, as you know far better than we parsons
how to preach: but let them have besides some glimpses of the splendid
fact, that outside their prison-house is a world which God, not man,
has made; wherein grows everywhere that tree of knowledge which is likewise
the tree of life; and that they have a right to some small share of
its beauty, and its wonder, and its rest, for their own health of soul
and body, and for the health of their children after them.</p>
<h2>NAUSICAA IN LONDON: OR, THE LOWER EDUCATION OF WOMAN.</h2>
<p>Fresh from the Marbles of the British Museum, I went my way through
London streets.&nbsp; My brain was still full of fair and grand forms;
the forms of men and women whose every limb and attitude betokened perfect
health, and grace, and power, and a self-possession and self-restraint
so habitual and complete that it had become unconscious, and undistinguishable
from the native freedom of the savage.&nbsp; For I had been up and down
the corridors of those Greek sculptures, which remain as a perpetual
sermon to rich and poor, amid our artificial, unwholesome, and it may
be decaying pseudo-civilisation; saying with looks more expressive than
all words&mdash;Such men and women can be; for such they have been;
and such you may be yet, if you will use that science of which you too
often only boast.&nbsp; Above all, I had been pondering over the awful
and yet tender beauty of the maiden figures from the Parthenon and its
kindred temples.&nbsp; And these, or such as these, I thought to myself,
were the sisters of the men who fought at Marathon and Salamis; the
mothers of many a man among the ten thousand whom Xenophon led back
from Babylon to the Black Sea shore; the ancestresses of many a man
who conquered the East in Alexander&rsquo;s host, and fought with Porus
in the far Punjab.&nbsp; And were these women mere dolls?&nbsp; These
men mere gladiators?&nbsp; Were they not the parents of philosophy,
science, poetry, the plastic arts?&nbsp; We talk of education now.&nbsp;
Are we more educated than were the ancient Greeks?&nbsp; Do we know
anything about education, physical, intellectual, or &aelig;sthetic,
and I may say moral likewise&mdash;religious education, of course, in
our sense of the word, they had none&mdash;but do we know anything about
education of which they have not taught us at least the rudiments?&nbsp;
Are there not some branches of education which they perfected, once
and for ever; leaving us northern barbarians to follow, or else not
to follow, their example?&nbsp; To produce health, that is, harmony
and sympathy, proportion and grace, in every faculty of mind and body&mdash;that
was their notion of education.&nbsp; To produce that, the text-book
of their childhood was the poetry of Homer, and not of&mdash;But I am
treading on dangerous ground.&nbsp; It was for this that the seafaring
Greek lad was taught to find his ideal in Ulysses; while his sister
at home found hers, it may be, in Nausicaa.&nbsp; It was for this, that
when perhaps the most complete and exquisite of all the Greeks, Sophocles
the good, beloved by gods and men, represented on the Athenian stage
his drama of Nausicaa, and, as usual, could not&mdash;for he had no
voice&mdash;himself take a speaking part, he was content to do one thing
in which he specially excelled; and dressed and masked as a girl, to
play at ball amid the chorus of Nausicaa&rsquo;s maidens.</p>
<p>That drama of Nausicaa is lost; and if I dare say so of any play
of Sophocles&rsquo;, I scarce regret it.&nbsp; It is well, perhaps,
that we have no second conception of the scene, to interfere with the
simplicity, so grand, and yet so tender, of Homer&rsquo;s idyllic episode.</p>
<p>Nausicaa, it must be remembered, is the daughter of a king.&nbsp;
But not of a king in the exclusive modern European or old Eastern sense.&nbsp;
Her father, Alcinous, is simply &ldquo;primus inter pares&rdquo; among
a community of merchants, who are called &ldquo;kings&rdquo; likewise;
and Mayor for life&mdash;so to speak&mdash;of a new trading city, a
nascent Genoa or Venice, on the shore of the Mediterranean.&nbsp; But
the girl Nausicaa, as she sleeps in her &ldquo;carved chamber,&rdquo;
is &ldquo;like the immortals in form and face;&rdquo; and two handmaidens
who sleep on each side of the polished door &ldquo;have beauty from
the Graces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her there enters, in the shape of some maiden friend, none less
than Pallas Athen&eacute; herself, intent on saving worthily her favourite,
the shipwrecked Ulysses; and bids her in a dream go forth&mdash;and
wash the clothes. <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72">{72}</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nausicaa, wherefore doth thy mother bear<br />
Child so forgetful?&nbsp; This long time doth rest,<br />
Like lumber in the house, much raiment fair.<br />
Soon must thou wed, and be thyself well-drest,<br />
And find thy bridegroom raiment of the best.<br />
These are the things whence good repute is born,<br />
And praises that make glad a parent&rsquo;s breast.<br />
Come, let us both go washing with the morn;<br />
So shalt thou have clothes becoming to be worn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know that thy maidenhood is not for long,<br />
Whom the Ph&oelig;acian chiefs already woo,<br />
Lords of the land whence thou thyself art sprung.<br />
Soon as the shining dawn comes forth anew,<br />
For wain and mules thy noble father sue,<br />
Which to the place of washing shall convey<br />
Girdles and shawls and rugs of splendid hue.<br />
This for thyself were better than essay<br />
Thither to walk: the place is distant a long way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Startled by her dream, Nausicaa awakes, and goes to find her parents&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One by the hearth sat, with the maids around,<br />
And on the skeins of yarn, sea-purpled, spent<br />
Her morning toil.&nbsp; Him to the council bound,<br />
Called by the honoured kings, just going forth she found.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And calling him, as she might now, &ldquo;Pappa phile,&rdquo; Dear
Papa, asks for the mule waggon: but it is her father&rsquo;s and her
five brothers&rsquo; clothes she fain would wash,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ashamed to name her marriage to her father dear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he understood all&mdash;and she goes forth in the mule waggon,
with the clothes, after her mother has put in &ldquo;a chest of all
kinds of delicate food, and meat, and wine in a goatskin;&rdquo; and
last but not least, the indispensable cruse of oil for anointing after
the bath, to which both Jews, Greeks, and Romans owed so much health
and beauty.&nbsp; And then we read in the simple verse of a poet too
refined, like the rest of his race, to see anything mean or ridiculous
in that which was not ugly and unnatural, how she and her maids got
into the &ldquo;polished waggon,&rdquo; &ldquo;with good wheels,&rdquo;
and she &ldquo;took the whip and the studded reins,&rdquo; and &ldquo;beat
them till they started;&rdquo; and how the mules &ldquo;rattled&rdquo;
away, and &ldquo;pulled against each other,&rdquo; till</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When they came to the fair flowing river<br />
Which feeds good lavatories all the year,<br />
Fitted to cleanse all sullied robes soever,<br />
They from the wain the mules unharnessed there,<br />
And chased them free, to crop their juicy fare<br />
By the swift river, on the margin green;<br />
Then to the waters dashed the clothes they bare<br />
And in the stream-filled trenches stamped them clean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which, having washed and cleansed, they spread before<br />
The sunbeams, on the beach, where most did lie<br />
Thick pebbles, by the sea-wave washed ashore.<br />
So, having left them in the heat to dry,<br />
They to the bath went down, and by-and-by,<br />
Rubbed with rich oil, their midday meal essay,<br />
Couched in green turf, the river rolling nigh.<br />
Then, throwing off their veils, at ball they play,<br />
While the white-armed Nausicaa leads the choral lay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mere beauty of this scene all will feel, who have the sense of
beauty in them.&nbsp; Yet it is not on that aspect which I wish to dwell,
but on its healthfulness.&nbsp; Exercise is taken, in measured time,
to the sound of song, as a duty almost, as well as an amusement.&nbsp;
For this game of ball, which is here mentioned for the first time in
human literature, nearly three thousand years ago, was held by the Greeks
and by the Romans after them, to be an almost necessary part of a liberal
education; principally, doubtless, from the development which it produced
in the upper half of the body, not merely to the arms, but to the chest,
by raising and expanding the ribs, and to all the muscles of the torso,
whether perpendicular or oblique.&nbsp; The elasticity and grace which
it was believed to give were so much prized, that a room for ball-play,
and a teacher of the art, were integral parts of every gymnasium; and
the Athenians went so far as to bestow on one famous ballplayer, Aristonicus
of Carystia, a statue and the rights of citizenship.&nbsp; The rough
and hardy young Spartans, when passing from boyhood into manhood, received
the title of ball-players, seemingly from the game which it was then
their special duty to learn.&nbsp; In the case of Nausicaa and her maidens,
the game would just bring into their right places all that is liable
to be contracted and weakened in women, so many of whose occupations
must needs be sedentary and stooping; while the song which accompanied
the game at once filled the lungs regularly and rhythmically, and prevented
violent motion, or unseemly attitude.&nbsp; We, the civilised, need
physiologists to remind us of these simple facts, and even then do not
act on them.&nbsp; Those old half-barbarous Greeks had found them out
for themselves, and, moreover, acted on them.</p>
<p>But fair Nausicaa must have been&mdash;some will say&mdash;surely
a mere child of nature, and an uncultivated person?</p>
<p>So far from it, that her whole demeanour and speech show culture
of the very highest sort, full of &ldquo;sweetness and light.&rdquo;&mdash;Intelligent
and fearless, quick to perceive the bearings of her strange and sudden
adventure, quick to perceive the character of Ulysses, quick to answer
his lofty and refined pleading by words as lofty and refined, and pious
withal;&mdash;for it is she who speaks to her handmaids the once so
famous words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Strangers and poor men all are sent from Zeus;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And alms, though small, are sweet&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clear of intellect, prompt of action, modest of demeanour, shrinking
from the slightest breath of scandal; while she is not ashamed, when
Ulysses, bathed and dressed, looks himself again, to whisper to her
maidens her wish that the Gods might send her such a spouse.&mdash;This
is Nausicaa as Homer draws her; and as many a scholar and poet since
Homer has accepted her for the ideal of noble maidenhood.&nbsp; I ask
my readers to study for themselves her interview with Ulysses, in Mr.
Worsley&rsquo;s translation, or rather in the grand simplicity of the
original Greek, <a name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76">{76}</a>
and judge whether Nausicaa is not as perfect a lady as the poet who
imagined her&mdash;or, it may be, drew her from life&mdash;must have
been a perfect gentleman; both complete in those &ldquo;manners&rdquo;
which, says the old proverb, &ldquo;make the man:&rdquo; but which are
the woman herself; because with her&mdash;who acts more by emotion than
by calculation&mdash;manners are the outward and visible tokens of her
inward and spiritual grace, or disgrace; and flow instinctively, whether
good or bad, from the instincts of her inner nature.</p>
<p>True, Nausicaa could neither read nor write.&nbsp; No more, most
probably, could the author of the Odyssey.&nbsp; No more, for that matter,
could Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, though they were plainly, both in mind
and manners, most highly-cultivated men.&nbsp; Reading and writing,
of course, have now become necessaries of humanity; and are to be given
to every human being, that he may start fair in the race of life.&nbsp;
But I am not aware that Greek women improved much, either in manners,
morals, or happiness, by acquiring them in after centuries.&nbsp; A
wise man would sooner see his daughter a Nausicaa than a Sappho, an
Aspasia, a Cleopatra, or even an Hypatia.</p>
<p>Full of such thoughts, I went through London streets, among the Nausicaas
of the present day; the girls of the period; the daughters and hereafter
mothers of our future rulers, the great Demos or commercial middle class
of the greatest mercantile city in the world: and noted what I had noted
with fear and sorrow, many a day, for many a year; a type, and an increasing
type, of young women who certainly had not had the &ldquo;advantages,&rdquo;
&ldquo;educational&rdquo; and other, of that Greek Nausicaa of old.</p>
<p>Of course, in such a city as London, to which the best of everything,
physical and other, gravitates, I could not but pass, now and then,
beautiful persons, who made me proud of those &ldquo;grandes Anglaises
aux joues rouges,&rdquo; whom the Parisiennes ridicule&mdash;and envy.&nbsp;
But I could not help suspecting that their looks showed them to be either
country-bred, or born of country parents; and this suspicion was strengthened
by the fact, that when compared with their mothers, the mother&rsquo;s
physique was, in the majority of cases, superior to the daughters&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Painful it was, to one accustomed to the ruddy well-grown peasant girl,
stalwart, even when, as often, squat and plain, to remark the exceedingly
small size of the average young woman; by which I do not mean mere want
of height&mdash;that is a little matter&mdash;but want of breadth likewise;
a general want of those large frames, which indicate usually a power
of keeping strong and healthy not merely the muscles, but the brain
itself.</p>
<p>Poor little things.&nbsp; I passed hundreds&mdash;I pass hundreds
every day&mdash;trying to hide their littleness by the nasty mass of
false hair&mdash;or what does duty for it; and by the ugly and useless
hat which is stuck upon it, making the head thereby look ridiculously
large and heavy; and by the high heels on which they totter onward,
having forgotten, or never learnt, the simple art of walking; their
bodies tilted forward in that ungraceful attitude which is called&mdash;why
that name of all others?&mdash;a &ldquo;Grecian bend;&rdquo; seemingly
kept on their feet, and kept together at all, in that strange attitude,
by tight stays which prevented all graceful and healthy motion of the
hips or sides; their raiment, meanwhile, being purposely misshapen in
this direction and in that, to hide&mdash;it must be presumed&mdash;deficiencies
of form.&nbsp; If that chignon and those heels had been taken off, the
figure which would have remained would have been that too often of a
puny girl of sixteen.&nbsp; And yet there was no doubt that these women
were not only full grown, but some of them, alas! wives and mothers.</p>
<p>Poor little things.&mdash;And this they have gained by so-called
civilisation: the power of aping the &ldquo;fashions&rdquo; by which
the worn-out Parisienne hides her own personal defects; and of making
themselves, by innate want of that taste which the Parisienne possesses,
only the cause of something like a sneer from many a cultivated man;
and of something like a sneer, too, from yonder gipsy woman who passes
by, with bold bright face, and swinging hip, and footstep stately and
elastic; far better dressed, according to all true canons of taste,
than most town-girls; and thanking her fate that she and her &ldquo;Rom&rdquo;
are no house-dwellers and gaslight-sightseers, but fatten on free air
upon the open moor.</p>
<p>But the face which is beneath that chignon and that hat?&nbsp; Well&mdash;it
is sometimes pretty: but how seldom handsome, which is a higher quality
by far.&nbsp; It is not, strange to say, a well-fed face.&nbsp; Plenty
of money, and perhaps too much, is spent on those fine clothes.&nbsp;
It had been better, to judge from the complexion, if some of that money
had been spent in solid wholesome food.&nbsp; She looks as if she lived&mdash;as
she too often does, I hear&mdash;on tea and bread-and-butter, or rather
on bread with the minimum of butter.&nbsp; For as the want of bone indicates
a deficiency of phosphatic food, so does the want of flesh about the
cheeks indicate a deficiency of hydrocarbon.&nbsp; Poor little Nausicaa:&mdash;that
is not her fault.&nbsp; Our boasted civilisation has not even taught
her what to eat, as it certainly has not increased her appetite; and
she knows not&mdash;what every country fellow knows&mdash;that without
plenty of butter and other fatty matters, she is not likely to keep
even warm.&nbsp; Better to eat nasty fat bacon now, than to supply the
want of it some few years hence by nastier cod-liver oil.&nbsp; But
there is no one yet to tell her that, and a dozen other equally simple
facts, for her own sake, and for the sake of that coming Demos which
she is to bring into the world; a Demos which, if we can only keep it
healthy in body and brain, has before it so splendid a future: but which,
if body and brain degrade beneath the influence of modern barbarism,
is but too likely to follow the Demos of ancient Byzantium, or of modern
Paris.</p>
<p>Ay, but her intellect.&nbsp; She is so clever, and she reads so much,
and she is going to be taught to read so much more.</p>
<p>Ah, well&mdash;there was once a science called physiognomy.&nbsp;
The Greeks, from what I can learn, knew more of it than any people since:
though the Italian painters and sculptors must have known much; far
more than we.&nbsp; In a more scientific civilisation there will be
such a science once more: but its laws, though still in the empiric
stage, are not altogether forgotten by some.&nbsp; Little children have
often a fine and clear instinct of them.&nbsp; Many cultivated and experienced
women have a fine and clear instinct of them likewise.&nbsp; And some
such would tell us that there is intellect in plenty in the modern Nausicaa:
but not of the quality which they desire for their country&rsquo;s future
good.&nbsp; Self-consciousness, eagerness, volubility, petulance, in
countenance, in gesture, and in voice&mdash;which last is too often
most harsh and artificial, the breath being sent forth through the closed
teeth, and almost entirely at the corners of the mouth&mdash;and, with
all this, a weariness often about the wrinkling forehead and the drooping
lids;&mdash;all these, which are growing too common, not among the Demos
only, nor only in the towns, are signs, they think, of the unrest of
unhealth, physical, intellectual, spiritual.&nbsp; At least they are
as different as two types of physiognomy in the same race can be, from
the expression both of face and gesture, in those old Greek sculptures,
and in the old Italian painters; and, it must be said, in the portraits
of Reynolds, and Gainsborough, Copley, and Romney.&nbsp; Not such, one
thinks, must have been the mothers of Britain during the latter half
of the last century and the beginning of the present; when their sons,
at times, were holding half the world at bay.</p>
<p>And if Nausicaa has become such in town: what is she when she goes
to the seaside, not to wash the clothes in fresh-water, but herself
in salt&mdash;the very salt-water, laden with decaying organisms, from
which, though not polluted further by a dozen sewers, Ulysses had to
cleanse himself, anointing, too, with oil, ere he was fit to appear
in the company of Nausicaa of Greece?&nbsp; She dirties herself with
the dirty salt-water; and probably chills and tires herself by walking
thither and back, and staying in too long; and then flaunts on the pier,
bedizened in garments which, for monstrosity of form and disharmony
of colours, would have set that Greek Nausicaa&rsquo;s teeth on edge,
or those of any average Hindoo woman now.&nbsp; Or, even sadder still,
she sits on chairs and benches all the weary afternoon, her head drooped
on her chest, over some novel from the &ldquo;Library;&rdquo; and then
returns to tea and shrimps, and lodgings of which the fragrance is not
unsuggestive, sometimes not unproductive, of typhoid fever.&nbsp; Ah,
poor Nausicaa of England!&nbsp; That is a sad sight to some who think
about the present, and have read about the past.&nbsp; It is not a sad
sight to see your old father&mdash;tradesman, or clerk, or what not&mdash;who
has done good work in his day, and hopes to do some more, sitting by
your old mother, who has done good work in her day&mdash;among the rest,
that heaviest work of all, the bringing you into the world and keeping
you in it till now&mdash;honest, kindly, cheerful folk enough, and not
inefficient in their own calling; though an average Northumbrian, or
Highlander, or Irish Easterling, beside carrying a brain of five times
the intellectual force, could drive five such men over the cliff with
his bare hands.&nbsp; It is not a sad sight, I say, to see them sitting
about upon those seaside benches, looking out listlessly at the water,
and the ships, and the sunlight, and enjoying, like so many flies upon
a wall, the novel act of doing nothing.&nbsp; It is not the old for
whom wise men are sad: but for you.&nbsp; Where is your vitality?&nbsp;
Where is your &ldquo;Lebensgl&uuml;ckseligkeit,&rdquo; your enjoyment
of superfluous life and power?&nbsp; Why can you not even dance and
sing, till now and then, at night, perhaps, when you ought to be safe
in bed, but when the weak brain, after receiving the day&rsquo;s nourishment,
has roused itself a second time into a false excitement of gaslight
pleasure?&nbsp; What there is left of it is all going into that foolish
book, which the womanly element in you, still healthy and alive, delights
in; because it places you in fancy in situations in which you will never
stand, and inspires you with emotions, some of which, it may be, you
had better never feel.&nbsp; Poor Nausicaa&mdash;old, some men think,
before you have been ever young.</p>
<p>And now they are going to &ldquo;develop&rdquo; you; and let you
have your share in &ldquo;the higher education of women,&rdquo; by making
you read more books, and do more sums, and pass examinations, and stoop
over desks at night after stooping over some other employment all day;
and to teach you Latin, and even Greek.</p>
<p>Well, we will gladly teach you Greek, if you learn thereby to read
the history of Nausicaa of old, and what manner of maiden she was, and
what was her education.&nbsp; You will admire her, doubtless.&nbsp;
But do not let your admiration limit itself to drawing a meagre half-medi&aelig;valized
design of her&mdash;as she never looked.&nbsp; Copy in your own person;
and even if you do not descend as low&mdash;or rise as high&mdash;as
washing the household clothes, at least learn to play at ball; and sing,
in the open air and sunshine, not in theatres and concert-rooms by gaslight;
and take decent care of your own health; and dress not like a &ldquo;Parisienne&rdquo;&mdash;nor,
of course, like Nausicaa of old, for that is to ask too much:&mdash;but
somewhat more like an average Highland lassie; and try to look like
her, and be like her, of whom Wordsworth sang&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A mien and face<br />
In which full plainly I can trace<br />
Benignity and home-bred sense,<br />
Ripening in perfect innocence.<br />
Here scattered, like a random seed,<br />
Remote from men, thou dost not need<br />
The embarrassed look of shy distress<br />
And maidenly shamefacedness.<br />
Thou wear&rsquo;st upon thy forehead clear<br />
The freedom of a mountaineer.<br />
A face with gladness overspread,<br />
Soft smiles, by human kindness bred,<br />
And seemliness complete, that sways<br />
Thy courtesies, about thee plays.<br />
With no restraint, save such as springs<br />
From quick and eager visitings<br />
Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach<br />
Of thy few words of English speech.<br />
A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife<br />
That gives thy gestures grace and life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, yet unspoilt Nausicaa of the North; descendant of the dark tender-hearted
Celtic girl, and the fair deep-hearted Scandinavian Viking, thank God
for thy heather and fresh air, and the kine thou tendest, and the wool
thou spinnest; and come not to seek thy fortune, child, in wicked London
town; nor import, as they tell me thou art doing fast, the ugly fashions
of that London town, clumsy copies of Parisian cockneydom, into thy
Highland home; nor give up the healthful and graceful, free and modest
dress of thy mother and thy mother&rsquo;s mother, to disfigure the
little kirk on Sabbath days with crinoline and corset, high-heeled boots,
and other women&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>It is proposed, just now, to assimilate the education of girls more
and more to that of boys.&nbsp; If that means that girls are merely
to learn more lessons, and to study what their brothers are taught,
in addition to what their mothers were taught; then it is to be hoped,
at least by physiologists and patriots, that the scheme will sink into
that limbo whither, in a free and tolerably rational country, all imperfect
and ill-considered schemes are sure to gravitate.&nbsp; But if the proposal
be a bon&acirc; fide one: then it must be borne in mind that in the
public schools of England, and in all private schools, I presume, which
take their tone from them, cricket and football are more or less compulsory,
being considered integral parts of an Englishman&rsquo;s education;
and that they are likely to remain so, in spite of all reclamations:
because masters and boys alike know that games do not, in the long run,
interfere with a boy&rsquo;s work; that the same boy will very often
excel in both; that the games keep him in health for his work; that
the spirit with which he takes to his games when in the lower school,
is a fair test of the spirit with which he will take to his work when
he rises into the higher school; and that nothing is worse for a boy
than to fall into that loafing, tuck-shop-haunting set, who neither
play hard nor work hard, and are usually extravagant, and often vicious.&nbsp;
Moreover, they know well that games conduce, not merely to physical,
but to moral health; that in the playing-field boys acquire virtues
which no books can give them; not merely daring and endurance, but,
better still, temper, self-restraint, fairness, honour, unenvious approbation
of another&rsquo;s success, and all that &ldquo;give and take&rdquo;
of life which stand a man in such good stead when he goes forth into
the world, and without which, indeed, his success is always maimed and
partial.</p>
<p>Now: if the promoters of higher education for women will compel girls
to any training analogous to our public school games; if, for instance,
they will insist on that most natural and wholesome of all exercises,
dancing, in order to develop the lower half of the body; on singing,
to expand the lungs and regulate the breath; and on some games&mdash;ball
or what not&mdash;which will ensure that raised chest, and upright carriage,
and general strength of the upper torso, without which full oxygenation
of the blood, and therefore general health, is impossible; if they will
sternly forbid tight stays, high heels, and all which interferes with
free growth and free motion; if they will consider carefully all which
has been written on the &ldquo;half-time system&rdquo; by Mr. Chadwick
and others; and accept the certain physical law that, in order to renovate
the brain day by day, the growing creature must have plenty of fresh
air and play, and that the child who learns for four hours and plays
for four hours, will learn more, and learn it more easily, than the
child who learns for the whole eight hours; if, in short, they will
teach girls not merely to understand the Greek tongue, but to copy somewhat
of the Greek physical training, of that &ldquo;music and gymnastic&rdquo;
which helped to make the cleverest race of the old world the ablest
race likewise: then they will earn the gratitude of the patriot and
the physiologist, by doing their best to stay the downward tendencies
of the physique, and therefore ultimately of the morale, in the coming
generation of English women.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that, as yet, I hear of but one movement in this
direction among the promoters of the &ldquo;higher education of women.&rdquo;
<a name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88">{88}</a>&nbsp; I trust
that the subject will be taken up methodically by those gifted ladies;
who have acquainted themselves, and are labouring to acquaint other
women, with the first principles of health; and that they may avail
to prevent the coming generations, under the unwholesome stimulant of
competitive examinations, and so forth, from &ldquo;developing&rdquo;
into so many Chinese-dwarfs&mdash;or idiots.</p>
<h2>THE AIR-MOTHERS.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Die Natur ist die Bewegung.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who are these who follow us softly over the moor in the autumn eve?&nbsp;
Their wings brush and rustle in the fir-boughs, and they whisper before
us and behind, as if they called gently to each other, like birds flocking
homeward to their nests.</p>
<p>The woodpecker on the pine-stems knows them, and laughs aloud for
joy as they pass.&nbsp; The rooks above the pasture know them, and wheel
round and tumble in their play.&nbsp; The brown leaves on the oak trees
know them, and flutter faintly, and beckon as they pass.&nbsp; And in
the chattering of the dry leaves there is a meaning, and a cry of weary
things which long for rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take us home, take us home, you soft air-mothers, now our
fathers the sunbeams are grown dull.&nbsp; Our green summer beauty is
all draggled, and our faces are grown wan and wan; and the buds, the
children whom we nourished, thrust us off, ungrateful, from our seats.&nbsp;
Waft us down, you soft air-mothers, upon your wings to the quiet earth,
that we may go to our home, as all things go, and become air and sunlight
once again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the bold young fir-seeds know them, and rattle impatient in their
cones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blow stronger, blow fiercer, slow air-mothers, and
shake us from our prisons of dead wood, that we may fly and spin away
north-eastward, each on his horny wing.&nbsp; Help us but to touch the
moorland yonder, and we will take good care of ourselves henceforth;
we will dive like arrows through the heather, and drive our sharp beaks
into the soil, and rise again as green trees toward the sunlight, and
spread out lusty boughs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They never think, bold fools, of what is coming, to bring them low
in the midst of their pride; of the reckless axe which will fell them,
and the saw which will shape them into logs; and the trains which will
roar and rattle over them, as they lie buried in the gravel of the way,
till they are ground and rotted into powder, and dug up and flung upon
the fire, that they too may return home, like all things, and become
air and sunlight once again.</p>
<p>And the air-mothers hear their prayers, and do their bidding: but
faintly; for they themselves are tired and sad.</p>
<p>Tired and sad are the air-mothers, and their garments rent and wan.&nbsp;
Look at them as they stream over the black forest, before the dim south-western
sun; long lines and wreaths of melancholy grey, stained with dull yellow
or dead dun.&nbsp; They have come far across the seas, and done many
a wild deed upon their way; and now that they have reached the land,
like shipwrecked sailors, they will lie down and weep till they can
weep no more.</p>
<p>Ah, how different were those soft air-mothers when, invisible to
mortal eyes, they started on their long sky-journey, five thousand miles
across the sea!&nbsp; Out of the blazing caldron which lies between
the two New Worlds, they leapt up when the great sun called them, in
whirls and spouts of clear hot steam; and rushed of their own passion
to the northward, while the whirling earth-ball whirled them east.&nbsp;
So north-eastward they rushed aloft, across the gay West Indian isles,
leaving below the glitter of the flying-fish, and the sidelong eyes
of cruel sharks; above the cane-fields and the plaintain-gardens, and
the cocoa-groves which fringe the shores; above the rocks which throbbed
with earthquakes, and the peaks of old volcanoes, cinder-strewn; while,
far beneath, the ghosts of their dead sisters hurried home upon the
north-east breeze.</p>
<p>Wild deeds they did as they rushed onward, and struggled and fought
among themselves, up and down, and round and backward, in the fury of
their blind hot youth.&nbsp; They heeded not the tree as they snapped
it, nor the ship as they whelmed it in the waves; nor the cry of the
sinking sailor, nor the need of his little ones on shore; hasty and
selfish even as children, and, like children, tamed by their own rage.&nbsp;
For they tired themselves by struggling with each other, and by tearing
the heavy water into waves; and their wings grew clogged with sea-spray,
and soaked more and more with steam.&nbsp; But at last the sea grew
cold beneath them, and their clear steam shrank to mist; and they saw
themselves and each other wrapped in dull rain-laden clouds.&nbsp; They
then drew their white cloud-garments round them, and veiled themselves
for very shame; and said, &ldquo;We have been wild and wayward: and,
alas! our pure bright youth is gone.&nbsp; But we will do one good deed
yet ere we die, and so we shall not have lived in vain.&nbsp; We will
glide onward to the land, and weep there; and refresh all things with
soft warm rain; and make the grass grow, the buds burst; quench the
thirst of man and beast, and wash the soiled world clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they are wandering past us, the air-mothers, to weep the leaves
into their graves; to weep the seeds into their seed-beds, and weep
the soil into the plains; to get the rich earth ready for the winter,
and then creep northward to the ice-world, and there die.</p>
<p>Weary, and still more weary, slowly, and more slowly still, they
will journey on far northward, across fast-chilling seas.&nbsp; For
a doom is laid upon them, never to be still again, till they rest at
the North Pole itself, the still axle of the spinning world; and sink
in death around it, and become white snow-clad ghosts.</p>
<p>But will they live again, those chilled air-mothers?&nbsp; Yes, they
must live again.&nbsp; For all things move for ever; and not even ghosts
can rest.&nbsp; So the corpses of their sisters, piling on them from
above, press them outward, press them southward toward the sun once
more; across the floes and round the icebergs, weeping tears of snow
and sleet, while men hate their wild harsh voices, and shrink before
their bitter breath.&nbsp; They know not that the cold bleak snow-storms,
as they hurtle from the black north-east, bear back the ghosts of the
soft air-mothers, as penitents, to their father, the great sun.</p>
<p>But as they fly southwards, warm life thrills them, and they drop
their loads of sleet and snow; and meet their young live sisters from
the south, and greet them with flash and thunder-peal.&nbsp; And, please
God, before many weeks are over, as we run Westward Ho, we shall overtake
the ghosts of these air-mothers, hurrying back toward their father,
the great sun.&nbsp; Fresh and bright under the fresh bright heaven,
they will race with us toward our home, to gain new heat, new life,
new power, and set forth about their work once more.&nbsp; Men call
them the south-west wind, those air-mothers; and their ghosts the north-east
trade; and value them, and rightly, because they bear the traders out
and home across the sea.&nbsp; But wise men, and little children, should
look on them with more seeing eyes; and say, &ldquo;May not these winds
be living creatures?&nbsp; They, too, are thoughts of God, to whom all
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For is not our life like their life?&nbsp; Do we not come and go
as they?&nbsp; Out of God&rsquo;s boundless bosom, the fount of life,
we came; through selfish, stormy youth, and contrite tears&mdash;just
not too late; through manhood not altogether useless; through slow and
chill old age, we return from Whence we came; to the Bosom of God once
more&mdash;to go forth again, it may be, with fresh knowledge, and fresh
powers, to nobler work.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Such was the prophecy which I learnt, or seemed to learn, from the
south-western wind off the Atlantic, on a certain delectable evening.&nbsp;
And it was fulfilled at night, as far as the gentle air-mothers could
fulfil it, for foolish man.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was a roaring in the woods all night;<br />
The rain came heavily and fell in floods;<br />
But now the sun is rising calm and bright,<br />
The birds are singing in the distant woods;<br />
Over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods,<br />
The jay makes answer as the magpie chatters,<br />
And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But was I a gloomy and distempered man, if, upon such a morn as that,
I stood on the little bridge across a certain brook, and watched the
water run, with something of a sigh?&nbsp; Or if, when the schoolboy
beside me lamented that the floods would surely be out, and his day&rsquo;s
fishing spoiled, I said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, my boy, that is a little
matter.&nbsp; Look at what you are seeing now, and understand what barbarism
and waste mean.&nbsp; Look at all that beautiful water which God has
sent us hither off the Atlantic, without trouble or expense to us.&nbsp;
Thousands, and tens of thousands, of gallons will run under this bridge
to-day; and what shall we do with it?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; And yet:
think only of the mills which that water would have turned.&nbsp; Think
how it might have kept up health and cleanliness in poor creatures packed
away in the back streets of the nearest town, or even in London itself.&nbsp;
Think even how country folk, in many parts of England, in three months&rsquo;
time, may be crying out for rain, and afraid of short crops, and fever,
and scarlatina, and cattle-plague, for want of the very water which
we are now letting run back, wasted, into the sea from whence it came.&nbsp;
And yet we call ourselves a civilised people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not wise, I know, to preach to boys.&nbsp; And yet, sometimes,
a man must speak his heart; even, like Midas&rsquo; slave, to the reeds
by the river side.&nbsp; And I had so often, fishing up and down full
many a stream, whispered my story to those same river-reeds; and told
them that my Lord the Sovereign Demos had, like old Midas, asses&rsquo;
ears in spite of all his gold, that I thought I might for once tell
it the boy likewise, in hope that he might help his generation to mend
that which my own generation does not seem like to mend.</p>
<p>I might have said more to him: but did not.&nbsp; For it is not well
to destroy too early the child&rsquo;s illusion, that people must be
wise because they are grown up, and have votes, and rule&mdash;or think
they rule&mdash;the world.&nbsp; The child will find out how true that
is soon enough for himself.&nbsp; If the truth be forced on him by the
hot words of those with whom he lives, it is apt to breed in him that
contempt, stormful and therefore barren, which makes revolutions; and
not that pity, calm and therefore helpful, which makes reforms.</p>
<p>So I might have said to him, but did not&mdash;</p>
<p>And then men pray for rain:</p>
<p>My boy, did you ever hear the old Eastern legend about the Gipsies?&nbsp;
How they were such good musicians, that some great Indian Sultan sent
for the whole tribe, and planted them near his palace, and gave them
land, and ploughs to break it up, and seed to sow it, that they might
dwell there, and play and sing to him.</p>
<p>But when the winter arrived, the Gipsies all came to the Sultan,
and cried that they were starving.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what have you done
with the seed-corn which I gave you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O Light of
the Age, we ate it in the summer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what have
you done with the ploughs which I gave you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O Glory
of the Universe, we burnt them to bake the corn withal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said that great Sultan&mdash;&ldquo;Like the butterflies you
have lived; and like the butterflies you shall wander.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So he drove them out.&nbsp; And that is how the Gipsies came hither
from the East.</p>
<p>Now suppose that the Sultan of all Sultans, who sends the rain, should
make a like answer to us foolish human beings, when we prayed for rain:
&ldquo;But what have you done with the rain which I gave you six months
since?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have let it run into the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then, ere you ask for more rain, make places wherein you can
keep it when you have it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But that would be, in
most cases, too expensive.&nbsp; We can employ our capital more profitably
in other directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not for me to say what answer might be made to such an excuse.&nbsp;
I think a child&rsquo;s still unsophisticated sense of right and wrong
would soon supply one; and probably one&mdash;considering the complexity,
and difficulty, and novelty, of the whole question&mdash;somewhat too
harsh; as children&rsquo;s judgments are wont to be.</p>
<p>But would it not be well if our children, without being taught to
blame anyone for what is past, were taught something about what ought
to be done now, what must be done soon, with the rainfall of these islands;
and about other and kindred health-questions, on the solution of which
depends, and will depend more and more, the life of millions?&nbsp;
One would have thought that those public schools and colleges which
desire to monopolise the education of the owners of the soil; of the
great employers of labour; of the clergy; and of all, indeed, who ought
to be acquainted with the duties of property, the conditions of public
health, and, in a word, with the general laws of what is now called
Social Science&mdash;one would have thought, I say, that these public
schools and colleges would have taught their scholars somewhat at least
about such matters, that they might go forth into life with at least
some rough notions of the causes which make people healthy or unhealthy,
rich or poor, comfortable or wretched, useful or dangerous to the State.&nbsp;
But as long as our great educational institutions, safe, or fancying
themselves safe, in some enchanted castle, shut out by ancient magic
from the living world, put a premium on Latin and Greek verses: a wise
father will, during the holidays, talk now and then, I hope, somewhat
after this fashion:&mdash;</p>
<p>You must understand, my boy, that all the water in the country comes
out of the sky, and from nowhere else; and that, therefore, to save
and store the water when it falls is a question of life and death to
crops, and man, and beast; for with or without water is life or death.&nbsp;
If I took, for instance, the water from the moors above and turned it
over yonder field, I could double, and more than double, the crops in
that field henceforth.</p>
<p>Then why do I not do it?</p>
<p>Only because the field lies higher than the house; and if&mdash;now
here is one thing which you and every civilised man should know&mdash;if
you have water-meadows, or any &ldquo;irrigated&rdquo; land, as it is
called, above a house, or even on a level with it, it is certain to
breed not merely cold and damp, but fever or ague.&nbsp; Our forefathers
did not understand this; and they built their houses, as this is built,
in the lowest places they could find: sometimes because they wished
to be near ponds, from whence they could get fish in Lent; but more
often, I think, because they wanted to be sheltered from the wind.&nbsp;
They had no glass, as we have, in their windows; or, at least, only
latticed casements, which let in the wind and cold; and they shrank
from high and exposed, and therefore really healthy, spots.&nbsp; But
now that we have good glass, and sash windows, and doors that will shut
tight, we can build warm houses where we like.&nbsp; And if you ever
have to do with the building of cottages, remember that it is your duty
to the people who will live in them, and therefore to the State, to
see that they stand high and dry, where no water can drain down into
their foundations, and where fog, and the poisonous gases which are
given out by rotting vegetables, cannot drain down either.&nbsp; You
will learn more about all that when you learn, as every civilised lad
should in these days, something about chemistry, and the laws of fluids
and gases.&nbsp; But you know already that flowers are cut off by frost
in the low grounds sooner than in the high; and that the fog at night
always lies along the brooks; and that the sour moor-smell which warns
us to shut our windows at sunset, comes down from the hill, and not
up from the valley.&nbsp; Now all these things are caused by one and
the same law; that cold air is heavier than warm; and, therefore, like
so much water, must run down hill.</p>
<p>But what about the rainfall?</p>
<p>Well, I have wandered a little from the rainfall: though not as far
as you fancy; for fever and ague and rheumatism usually mean&mdash;rain
in the wrong place.&nbsp; But if you knew how much illness, and torturing
pain, and death, and sorrow arise, even to this very day, from ignorance
of these simple laws, then you would bear them carefully in mind, and
wish to know more about them.&nbsp; But now for water being life to
the beasts.&nbsp; Do you remember&mdash;though you are hardly old enough&mdash;the
cattle-plague?&nbsp; How the beasts died, or had to be killed and buried,
by tens of thousands; and how misery and ruin fell on hundreds of honest
men and women over many of the richest counties of England: but how
we in this vale had no cattle-plague; and how there was none&mdash;as
far as I recollect&mdash;in the uplands of Devon and Cornwall, nor of
Wales, nor of the Scotch Highlands?&nbsp; Now, do you know why that
was?&nbsp; Simply because we here, like those other uplanders, are in
such a country as Palestine was before the foolish Jews cut down all
their timber, and so destroyed their own rainfall&mdash;a &ldquo;land
of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys
and hills.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is hardly a field here that has not, thank
God, its running brook, or its sweet spring, from which our cattle were
drinking their health and life, while in the clay-lands of Cheshire,
and in the Cambridgeshire fens&mdash;which were drained utterly dry&mdash;the
poor things drank no water, too often, save that of the very same putrid
ponds in which they had been standing all day long, to cool themselves,
and to keep off the flies.&nbsp; I do not say, of course, that bad water
caused the cattle-plague.&nbsp; It came by infection from the East of
Europe.&nbsp; But I say that bad water made the cattle ready to take
it, and made it spread over the country; and when you are old enough
I will give you plenty of proof&mdash;some from the herds of your own
kinsmen&mdash;that what I say is true.</p>
<p>And as for pure water being life to human beings: why have we never
fever here, and scarcely ever diseases like fever&mdash;zymotics, as
the doctors call them?&nbsp; Or, if a case comes into our parish from
outside, why does the fever never spread?&nbsp; For the very same reason
that we had no cattle-plague.&nbsp; Because we have more pure water
close to every cottage than we need.&nbsp; And this I tell you: that
the only two outbreaks of deadly disease which we have had here for
thirty years, were both of them, as far as I could see, to be traced
to filthy water having got into the poor folk&rsquo;s wells.&nbsp; Water,
you must remember, just as it is life when pure, is death when foul.&nbsp;
For it can carry, unseen to the eye, and even when it looks clear and
sparkling, and tastes soft and sweet, poisons which have perhaps killed
more human beings than ever were killed in battle.&nbsp; You have read,
perhaps, how the Athenians, when they were dying of the plague, accused
the Laced&aelig;monians outside the walls of poisoning their wells;
or how, in some of the pestilences of the middle ages, the common people
used to accuse the poor harmless Jews of poisoning the wells, and set
upon them and murdered them horribly.&nbsp; They were right, I do not
doubt, in their notion that the well-water was giving them the pestilence:
but they had not sense to see that they were poisoning the wells themselves
by their dirt and carelessness; or, in the case of poor besieged Athens,
probably by mere overcrowding, which has cost many a life ere now, and
will cost more.&nbsp; And I am sorry to tell you, my little man, that
even now too many people have no more sense than they had, and die in
consequence.&nbsp; If you could see a battle-field, and men shot down,
writhing and dying in hundreds by shell and bullet, would not that seem
to you a horrid sight?&nbsp; Then&mdash;I do not wish to make you sad
too early, but this is a fact which everyone should know&mdash;that
more people, and not strong men only, but women and little children
too, are killed and wounded in Great Britain every year by bad water
and want of water together, than were killed and wounded in any battle
which has been fought since you were born.&nbsp; Medical men know this
well.&nbsp; And when you are older, you may see it for yourself in the
Registrar-General&rsquo;s reports, blue-books, pamphlets, and so on,
without end.</p>
<p>But why do not people stop such a horrible loss of life?</p>
<p>Well, my dear boy, the true causes of it have only been known for
the last thirty or forty years; and we English are, as good King Alfred
found us to his sorrow a thousand years ago, very slow to move, even
when we see a thing ought to be done.&nbsp; Let us hope that in this
matter&mdash;we have been so in most matters as yet&mdash;we shall be
like the tortoise in the fable, and not the hare; and by moving slowly,
but surely, win the race at last.&nbsp; But now think for yourself:
and see what you would do to save these people from being poisoned by
bad water.&nbsp; Remember that the plain question is this&mdash;The
rainwater comes down from heaven as water, and nothing but water.&nbsp;
Rainwater is the only pure water, after all.&nbsp; How would you save
that for the poor people who have none?&nbsp; There; run away and hunt
rabbits on the moor: but look, meanwhile, how you would save some of
this beautiful and precious water which is roaring away into the sea.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Well?&nbsp; What would you do?&nbsp; Make ponds, you say, like the
old monks&rsquo; ponds, now all broken down.&nbsp; Dam all the glens
across their mouths, and turn them into reservoirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings&rdquo;&mdash;Well,
that will have to be done.&nbsp; That is being done more and more, more
or less well.&nbsp; The good people of Glasgow did it first, I think;
and now the good people of Manchester, and of other northern towns,
have done it, and have saved many a human life thereby already.&nbsp;
But it must be done, some day, all over England and Wales, and great
part of Scotland.&nbsp; For the mountain tops and moors, my boy, by
a beautiful law of nature, compensate for their own poverty by yielding
a wealth which the rich lowlands cannot yield.&nbsp; You do not understand?&nbsp;
Then see.&nbsp; Yon moor above can grow neither corn nor grass.&nbsp;
But one thing it can grow, and does grow, without which we should have
no corn nor grass, and that is&mdash;water.&nbsp; Not only does far
more rain fall up there than falls here down below, but even in drought
the high moors condense the moisture into dew, and so yield some water,
even when the lowlands are burnt up with drought.&nbsp; The reason of
that you must learn hereafter.&nbsp; That it is so, you should know
yourself.&nbsp; For on the high chalk downs, you know, where farmers
make a sheep-pond, they never, if they are wise, make it in a valley
or on a hill-side, but on the bleakest top of the very highest down;
and there, if they can once get it filled with snow and rain in winter,
the blessed dews of night will keep some water in it all the summer
through, while the ponds below are utterly dried up.&nbsp; And even
so it is, as I know, with this very moor.&nbsp; Corn and grass it will
not grow, because there is too little &ldquo;staple,&rdquo; that is,
soluble minerals, in the sandy soil.&nbsp; But how much water it might
grow, you may judge roughly for yourself, by remembering how many brooks
like this are running off it now to carry mere dirt into the river,
and then into the sea.</p>
<p>But why should we not make dams at once; and save the water?</p>
<p>Because we cannot afford it.&nbsp; No one would buy the water when
we had stored it.&nbsp; The rich in town and country will always take
care&mdash;and quite right they are&mdash;to have water enough for themselves,
and for their servants too, whatever it may cost them.&nbsp; But the
poorer people are&mdash;and therefore usually, alas! the more ignorant&mdash;the
less water they get; and the less they care to have water; and the less
they are inclined to pay for it; and the more, I am sorry to say, they
waste what little they do get; and I am still more sorry to say, spoil,
and even steal and sell&mdash;in London at least&mdash;the stop-cocks
and lead-pipes which bring the water into their houses.&nbsp; So that
keeping a water-shop is a very troublesome and uncertain business; and
one which is not likely to pay us or any one round here.</p>
<p>But why not let some company manage it, as they manage railways,
and gas, and other things?</p>
<p>Ah&mdash;you have been overhearing a good deal about companies of
late, I see.&nbsp; But this I will tell you; that when you grow up,
and have a vote and influence, it will be your duty, if you intend to
be a good citizen, not only not to put the water-supply of England into
the hands of fresh companies, but to help to take out of their hands
what water-supply they manage already, especially in London; and likewise
the gas-supply; and the railroads; and everything else, in a word, which
everybody uses, and must use.&nbsp; For you must understand&mdash;at
least as soon as you can&mdash;that though the men who make up companies
are no worse than other men, and some of them, as you ought to know,
very good men; yet what they have to look to is their profits; and the
less water they supply, and the worse it is, the more profit they make.&nbsp;
For most water, I am sorry to say, is fouled before the water companies
can get to it, as this water which runs past us will be, and as the
Thames water above London is.&nbsp; Therefore it has to be cleansed,
or partly cleansed, at a very great expense.&nbsp; So water companies
have to be inspected&mdash;in plain English, watched&mdash;at a very
heavy expense to the nation, by government officers; and compelled to
do their best, and take their utmost care.&nbsp; And so it has come
to pass that the London water is not now nearly as bad as some of it
was thirty years ago, when it was no more fit to drink than that in
the cattle yard tank.&nbsp; But still we must have more water, and better,
in London; for it is growing year by year.&nbsp; There are more than
three millions of people already in what we call London; and ere you
are an old man there may be between four and five millions.&nbsp; Now
to supply all these people with water is a duty which we must not leave
to any private companies.&nbsp; It must be done by a public authority,
as is fit and proper in a free self-governing country.&nbsp; In this
matter, as in all others, we will try to do what the Royal Commission
told us four years ago we ought to do.&nbsp; I hope that you will see,
though I may not, the day when what we call London, but which is really,
nine-tenths of it, only a great nest of separate villages huddled together,
will be divided into three great self-governing cities, London, Westminster,
and Southwark; each with its own corporation, like that of the venerable
and well-governed City of London; each managing its own water-supply,
gas-supply, and sewage, and other matters besides; and managing them,
like Dublin, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and other great northern
towns, far more cheaply and far better than any companies can do it
for them.</p>
<p>But where shall we get water enough for all these millions of people?&nbsp;
There are no mountains near London.&nbsp; But we might give them the
water off our moors.</p>
<p>No, no, my boy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He that will not when he may,<br />
When he will, he shall have nay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some fifteen years ago the Londoners might have had water from us;
and I was one of those who did my best to get it for them: but the water
companies did not choose to take it; and now this part of England is
growing so populous and so valuable that it wants all its little rainfall
for itself.&nbsp; So there is another leaf torn out of the Sibylline
books for the poor old water companies.&nbsp; You do not understand:
you will some day.&nbsp; But you may comfort yourself about London.&nbsp;
For it happens to be, I think, the luckiest city in the world; and if
it had not been, we should have had pestilence on pestilence in it,
as terrible as the great plague of Charles II.&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; The
old Britons, without knowing in the least what they were doing, settled
old London city in the very centre of the most wonderful natural reservoir
in this island, or perhaps in all Europe; which reaches from Kent into
Wiltshire, and round again into Suffolk; and that is, the dear old chalk
downs.</p>
<p>Why, they are always dry.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; But the turf on them never burns up, and the streams which
flow through them never run dry, and seldom or never flood either.&nbsp;
Do you not know, from Winchester, that that is true?&nbsp; Then where
is all the rain and snow gone, which falls on them year by year, but
into the chalk itself, and into the greensands, too, below the chalk?&nbsp;
There it is, soaked up as by a sponge, in quantity incalculable; enough,
some think, to supply London, let it grow as huge as it may.&nbsp; I
wish I too were sure of that.&nbsp; But the Commission has shown itself
so wise and fair, and brave likewise&mdash;too brave, I am sorry to
say, for some who might have supported them&mdash;that it is not for
me to gainsay their opinion.</p>
<p>But if there was not water enough in the chalk, are not the Londoners
rich enough to bring it from any distance?</p>
<p>My boy, in this also we will agree with the Commission&mdash;that
we ought not to rob Peter to pay Paul, and take water to a distance
which other people close at hand may want.&nbsp; Look at the map of
England and southern Scotland; and see for yourself what is just, according
to geography and nature.&nbsp; There are four mountain-ranges; four
great water-fields.&nbsp; First, the hills of the Border.&nbsp; Their
rainfall ought to be stored for the Lothians and the extreme north of
England.&nbsp; Then the Yorkshire and Derbyshire hills&mdash;the central
chine of England.&nbsp; Their rainfall is being stored already, to the
honour of the shrewd northern men, for the manufacturing counties east
and west of the hills.&nbsp; Then come the lake mountains&mdash;the
finest water-field of all, because more rain by far falls there than
in any place in England.&nbsp; But they will be wanted to supply Lancashire,
and some day Liverpool itself; for Liverpool is now using rain which
belongs more justly to other towns; and besides, there are plenty of
counties and towns, down into Cheshire, which would be glad of what
water Lancashire does not want.&nbsp; And last come the Snowdon mountains,
a noble water-field, which I know well; for an old dream of mine has
been, that ere I died I should see all the rain of the Carnedds, and
the Glyders, and Siabod, and Snowdon itself, carried across the Conway
river to feed the mining districts of North Wales, where the streams
are now all foul with oil and lead; and then on into the western coal
and iron fields, to Wolverhampton and Birmingham itself: and if I were
the engineer who got that done, I should be happier&mdash;prouder I
dare not say&mdash;than if I had painted nobler pictures than Raffaelle,
or written nobler plays than Shakespeare.&nbsp; I say that, boy, in
most deliberate earnest.&nbsp; But meanwhile, do you not see that in
districts where coal and iron may be found, and fresh manufactures may
spring up any day in any place, each district has a right to claim the
nearest rainfall for itself?&nbsp; And now, when we have got the water
into its proper place, let us see what we shall do with it.</p>
<p>But why do you say we?&nbsp; Can you and I do all this?</p>
<p>My boy, are not you and I free citizens; part of the people, the
Commons&mdash;as the good old word runs&mdash;of this country?&nbsp;
And are we not&mdash;or ought we not to be in time&mdash;beside that,
educated men?&nbsp; By the people, remember, I mean, not only the hand-working
man who has just got a vote; I mean the clergy of all denominations;
and the gentlemen of the press; and last, but not least, the scientific
men.&nbsp; If those four classes together were to tell every government&mdash;&ldquo;Free
water we will have, and as much as we reasonably choose;&rdquo; and
tell every candidate for the House of Commons,&mdash;&ldquo;Unless you
promise to get us as much free water as we reasonably choose, we will
not return you to Parliament:&rdquo; then, I think, we four should put
such a &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; on government as no water companies, or
other vested interests, could long resist.&nbsp; And if any of those
four classes should hang back, and waste their time and influence over
matters far less important and less pressing, the other three must laugh
at them, and more than laugh at them; and ask them&mdash;&ldquo;Why
have you education, why have you influence, why have you votes, why
are you freemen and not slaves, if not to preserve the comfort, the
decency, the health, the lives of men, women, and children&mdash;most
of those latter your own wives and your own children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what shall we do with the water?</p>
<p>Well, after all, that is a more practical matter than speculations
grounded on the supposition that all classes will do their duty.&nbsp;
But the first thing we will do will be to give to the very poorest houses
a constant supply, at high pressure; so that everybody may take as much
water as he likes, instead of having to keep the water in little cisterns,
where it gets foul and putrid only too often.</p>
<p>But will they not waste it then?</p>
<p>So far from it, wherever the water has been laid on at high pressure,
the waste, which is terrible now&mdash;some say that in London one-third
of the water is wasted&mdash;begins to lessen; and both water and expense
are saved.&nbsp; If you will only think, you will see one reason why.&nbsp;
If a woman leaves a high-pressure tap running, she will flood her place
and her neighbour&rsquo;s too.&nbsp; She will be like the magician&rsquo;s
servant, who called up the demon to draw water for him; and so he did:
but when he had begun he would not stop, and if the magician had not
come home, man and house would have been washed away.</p>
<p>But if it saves money, why do not the water companies do it?</p>
<p>Because&mdash;and really here there are many excuses for the poor
old water companies, when so many of them swerve and gib at the very
mention of constant water-supply, like a poor horse set to draw a load
which he feels is too heavy for him&mdash;because, to keep everything
in order among dirty, careless, and often drunken people, there must
be officers with lawful authority&mdash;water-policemen we will call
them&mdash;who can enter people&rsquo;s houses when they will, and if
they find anything wrong with the water, set it to rights with a high
hand, and even summon the people who have set it wrong.&nbsp; And that
is a power which, in a free country, must never be given to the servants
of any private company, but only to the officers of a corporation or
of the government.</p>
<p>And what shall we do with the rest of the water?</p>
<p>Well, we shall have, I believe, so much to spare that we may at least
do this&mdash;In each district of each city, and the centre of each
town, we may build public baths and lavatories, where poor men and women
may get their warm baths when they will; for now they usually never
bathe at all, because they will not&mdash;and ought not, if they be
hard-worked folk&mdash;bathe in cold water during nine months of the
year.&nbsp; And there they shall wash their clothes, and dry them by
steam; instead of washing them as now, at home, either under back sheds,
where they catch cold and rheumatism, or too often, alas! in their own
living rooms, in an atmosphere of foul vapour, which drives the father
to the public-house and the children into the streets; and which not
only prevents the clothes from being thoroughly dried again, but is,
my dear boy, as you will know when you are older, a very hot-bed of
disease.&nbsp; And they shall have other comforts, and even luxuries,
these public lavatories; and be made, in time, graceful and refining,
as well as merely useful.&nbsp; Nay, we will even, I think, have in
front of each of them a real fountain; not like the drinking-fountains&mdash;though
they are great and needful boons&mdash;which you see here and there
about the streets, with a tiny dribble of water to a great deal of expensive
stone: but real fountains, which shall leap, and sparkle, and plash,
and gurgle; and fill the place with life, and light, and coolness; and
sing in the people&rsquo;s ears the sweetest of all earthly songs&mdash;save
the song of a mother over her child&mdash;the song of &ldquo;The Laughing
Water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But will not that be a waste?</p>
<p>Yes, my boy.&nbsp; And for that very reason, I think we, the people,
will have our fountains; if it be but to make our governments, and corporations,
and all public bodies and officers, remember that they all&mdash;save
Her Majesty the Queen&mdash;are our servants; and not we theirs; and
that we choose to have water, not only to wash with, but to play with,
if we like.&nbsp; And I believe&mdash;for the world, as you will find,
is full not only of just but of generous souls&mdash;that if the water-supply
were set really right, there would be found, in many a city, many a
generous man who, over and above his compulsory water-rate, would give
his poor fellow-townsmen such a real fountain as those which ennoble
the great square at Carcasonne and the great square at Nismes; to be
&ldquo;a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, if you want to go back to your Latin and Greek, you shall
translate for me into Latin&mdash;I do not expect you to do it into
Greek, though it would turn very well into Greek, for the Greeks knew
all about the matter long before the Romans&mdash;what follows here;
and you shall verify the facts and the names, &amp;c., in it from your
dictionaries of antiquity and biography, that you may remember all the
better what it says.&nbsp; And by that time, I think, you will have
learnt something more useful to yourself, and, I hope, to your country
hereafter, than if you had learnt to patch together the neatest Greek
and Latin verses which have appeared since the days of Mr. Canning.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>I have often amused myself, by fancying one question which an old
Roman emperor would ask, were he to rise from his grave and visit the
sights of London under the guidance of some minister of state.&nbsp;
The august shade would, doubtless, admire, our railroads and bridges,
our cathedrals and our public parks, and much more of which we need
not be ashamed.&nbsp; But after a while, I think, he would look round,
whether in London or in most of our great cities, inquiringly and in
vain, for one class of buildings, which in his empire were wont to be
almost as conspicuous and as splendid, because, in public opinion, almost
as necessary, as the basilicas and temples&mdash;&ldquo;And where,&rdquo;
he would ask, &ldquo;are your public baths?&rdquo;&nbsp; And if the
minister of state who was his guide should answer&mdash;&ldquo;O great
C&aelig;sar, I really do not know.&nbsp; I believe there are some somewhere
at the back of that ugly building which we call the National Gallery;
and I think there have been some meetings lately in the East End, and
an amateur concert at the Albert Hall, for restoring, by private subscriptions,
some baths and wash-houses in Bethnal Green, which had fallen to decay.&nbsp;
And there may be two or three more about the metropolis; for parish
vestries have powers by Act of Parliament to establish such places,
if they think fit, and choose to pay for them out of the rates:&rdquo;&mdash;Then,
I think, the august shade might well make answer&mdash;&ldquo;We used
to call you, in old Rome, northern barbarians.&nbsp; It seems that you
have not lost all your barbarian habits.&nbsp; Are you aware that, in
every city in the Roman empire, there were, as a matter of course, public
baths open, not only to the poorest freeman, but to the slave, usually
for the payment of the smallest current coin, and often gratuitously?&nbsp;
Are you aware that in Rome itself, millionaire after millionaire, emperor
after emperor, from Menenius Agrippa and Nero down to Diocletian and
Constantine, built baths, and yet more baths; and connected with them
gymnasia for exercise, lecture-rooms, libraries, and porticos, wherein
the people might have shade and shelter, and rest?&mdash;I remark, by-the-by,
that I have not seen in all your London a single covered place in which
the people may take shelter during a shower&mdash;Are you aware that
these baths were of the most magnificent architecture, decorated with
marbles, paintings, sculptures, fountains, what not?&nbsp; And yet I
had heard, in Hades down below, that you prided yourselves here on the
study of the learned languages; and, indeed, taught little but Greek
and Latin at your public schools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, if the minister should make reply&mdash;&ldquo;Oh yes, we know
all this.&nbsp; Even since the revival of letters in the end of the
fifteenth century a whole literature has been written&mdash;a great
deal of it, I fear, by pedants who seldom washed even their hands and
faces&mdash;about your Greek and Roman baths.&nbsp; We visit their colossal
ruins in Italy and elsewhere with awe and admiration; and the discovery
of a new Roman bath in any old city of our isles sets all our antiquaries
buzzing with interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; the shade might ask, &ldquo;do you not copy
an example which you so much admire?&nbsp; Surely England must be much
in want, either of water, or of fuel to heat it with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, our rainfall is almost too great; our soil
so damp that we have had to invent a whole art of subsoil drainage unknown
to you; while, as for fuel, our coal-mines make us the great fuel-exporting
people of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a quiet sneer might curl the lip of a Constantine as he replied&mdash;&ldquo;Not
in vain, as I said, did we call you, some fifteen hundred years ago,
the barbarians of the north.&nbsp; But tell me, good barbarian, whom
I know to be both brave and wise&mdash;for the fame of your young British
empire has reached us even in the realms below, and we recognise in
you, with all respect, a people more like us Romans than any which has
appeared on earth for many centuries&mdash;how is it you have forgotten
that sacred duty of keeping the people clean, which you surely at one
time learnt from us?&nbsp; When your ancestors entered our armies, and
rose, some of them, to be great generals, and even emperors, like those
two Teuton peasants, Justin and Justinian, who, long after my days,
reigned in my own Constantinople: then, at least, you saw baths, and
used them; and felt, after the bath, that you were civilised men, and
not &lsquo;sordidi ac f&oelig;tentes,&rsquo; as we used to call you
when fresh out of your bullock-waggons and cattle-pens.&nbsp; How is
it that you have forgotten that lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister, I fear, would have to answer that our ancestors were
barbarous enough, not only to destroy the Roman cities, and temples,
and basilicas, and statues, but the Roman baths likewise; and then retired,
each man to his own freehold in the country, to live a life not much
more cleanly or more graceful than that of the swine which were his
favourite food.&nbsp; But he would have a right to plead, as an excuse,
that not only in England, but throughout the whole of the conquered
Latin empire, the Latin priesthood, who, in some respects, were&mdash;to
their honour&mdash;the representatives of Roman civilisation and the
protectors of its remnants, were the determined enemies of its cleanliness;
that they looked on personal dirt&mdash;like the old hermits of the
Thebaid&mdash;as a sign of sanctity; and discouraged&mdash;as they are
said to do still in some of the Romance countries of Europe&mdash;the
use of the bath, as not only luxurious, but also indecent.</p>
<p>At which answer, it seems to me, another sneer might curl the lip
of the august shade, as he said to himself&mdash;&ldquo;This, at least,
I did not expect, when I made Christianity the state religion of my
empire.&nbsp; But you, good barbarian, look clean enough.&nbsp; You
do not look on dirt as a sign of sanctity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, sire, the upper classes of our empire boast
of being the cleanliest&mdash;perhaps the only perfectly cleanly&mdash;people
in the world: except, of course, the savages of the South Seas.&nbsp;
And dirt is so far from being a thing which we admire, that our scientific
men&mdash;than whom the world has never seen wiser&mdash;have proved
to us, for a whole generation past, that dirt is the fertile cause of
disease and drunkenness, misery and recklessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, therefore,&rdquo; replies the shade, ere he disappears,
&ldquo;of discontent and revolution; followed by a tyranny endured,
as in Rome and many another place, by men once free; because tyranny
will at least do for them what they are too lazy, and cowardly, and
greedy to do for themselves.&nbsp; Farewell, and prosper; as you seem
likely to prosper, on the whole.&nbsp; But if you wish me to consider
you a civilised nation: let me hear that you have brought a great river
from the depths of the earth, be they a thousand fathoms deep, or from
your nearest mountains, be they five hundred miles away; and have washed
out London&rsquo;s dirt&mdash;and your own shame.&nbsp; Till then, abstain
from judging too harshly a Constantine, or even a Caracalla; for they,
whatever were their sins, built baths, and kept their people clean.&nbsp;
But do your gymnasia&mdash;your schools and universities, teach your
youth nought about all this?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THRIFT.&nbsp; A LECTURE DELIVERED AT WINCHESTER, MARCH 17, 1869.</h2>
<p>Ladies,&mdash;I have chosen for the title of this lecture a practical
and prosaic word, because I intend the lecture itself to be as practical
and prosaic as I can make it, without becoming altogether dull.</p>
<p>The question of the better or worse education of women is one far
too important for vague sentiment, wild aspirations, or Utopian dreams.</p>
<p>It is a practical question, on which depends not merely money or
comfort, but too often health and life, as the consequences of a good
education, or disease and death&mdash;I know too well of what I speak&mdash;as
the consequences of a bad one.</p>
<p>I beg you, therefore, to put out of your minds at the outset any
fancy that I wish for a social revolution in the position of women;
or that I wish to see them educated by exactly the same methods, and
in exactly the same subjects, as men.&nbsp; British lads, on an average,
are far too ill-taught still, in spite of all recent improvements, for
me to wish that British girls should be taught in the same way.</p>
<p>Moreover, whatever defects there may have been&mdash;and defects
there must be in all things human&mdash;in the past education of British
women, it has been most certainly a splendid moral success.&nbsp; It
has made, by the grace of God, British women the best wives, mothers,
daughters, aunts, sisters, that the world, as far as I can discover,
has yet seen.</p>
<p>Let those who will sneer at the women of England.&nbsp; We who have
to do the work and to fight the battle of life know the inspiration
which we derive from their virtue, their counsel, their tenderness,
and&mdash;but too often&mdash;from their compassion and their forgiveness.&nbsp;
There is, I doubt not, still left in England many a man with chivalry
and patriotism enough to challenge the world to show so perfect a specimen
of humanity as a cultivated British woman.</p>
<p>But just because a cultivated British woman is so perfect a personage;
therefore I wish to see all British women cultivated.&nbsp; Because
the womanhood of England is so precious a treasure; I wish to see none
of it wasted.&nbsp; It is an invaluable capital, or material, out of
which the greatest possible profit to the nation must be made.&nbsp;
And that can only be done by thrift; and that, again, can only be attained
by knowledge.</p>
<p>Consider that word thrift.&nbsp; If you will look at Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
Dictionary, or if you know your Shakespeare, you will see that thrift
signified originally profits, gain, riches gotten&mdash;in a word, the
marks of a man&rsquo;s thriving.</p>
<p>How, then, did the word thrift get to mean parsimony, frugality,
the opposite of waste?&nbsp; Just in the same way as economy&mdash;which
first, of course, meant the management of a household&mdash;got to mean
also the opposite of waste.</p>
<p>It was found that in commerce, in husbandry, in any process, in fact,
men throve in proportion as they saved their capital, their material,
their force.</p>
<p>Now this is a great law which runs through life; one of those laws
of nature&mdash;call them, rather, laws of God&mdash;which apply not
merely to political economy, to commerce, and to mechanics; but to physiology,
to society; to the intellect, to the heart, of every person in this
room.</p>
<p>The secret of thriving is thrift; saving of force; to get as much
work as possible done with the least expenditure of power, the least
jar and obstruction, the least wear and tear.</p>
<p>And the secret of thrift is knowledge.&nbsp; In proportion as you
know the laws and nature of a subject, you will be able to work at it
easily, surely, rapidly, successfully; instead of wasting your money
or your energies in mistaken schemes, irregular efforts, which end in
disappointment and exhaustion.</p>
<p>The secret of thrift, I say, is knowledge.&nbsp; The more you know,
the more you can save yourself and that which belongs to you; and can
do more work with less effort.</p>
<p>A knowledge of the laws of commercial credit, we all know, saves
capital, enabling a less capital to do the work of a greater.&nbsp;
Knowledge of the electric telegraph saves time; knowledge of writing
saves human speech and locomotion; knowledge of domestic economy saves
income; knowledge of sanitary laws saves health and life; knowledge
of the laws of the intellect saves wear and tear of brain; and knowledge
of the laws of the spirit&mdash;what does it not save?</p>
<p>A well-educated moral sense, a well-regulated character, saves from
idleness and ennui, alternating with sentimentality and excitement,
those tenderer emotions, those deeper passions, those nobler aspirations
of humanity, which are the heritage of the woman far more than of the
man; and which are potent in her, for evil or for good, in proportion
as they are left to run wild and undisciplined, or are trained and developed
into graceful, harmonious, self-restraining strength, beautiful in themselves,
and a blessing to all who come under their influence.</p>
<p>What, therefore, I recommend to ladies in this lecture is thrift;
thrift of themselves and of their own powers: and knowledge as the parent
of thrift.</p>
<p>And because it is well to begin with the lower applications of thrift,
and to work up to the higher, I am much pleased to hear that the first
course of the proposed lectures to women in this place will be one on
domestic economy.</p>
<p>I presume that the learned gentleman who will deliver these lectures
will be the last to mean by that term the mere saving of money; that
he will tell you, as&mdash;being a German&mdash;he will have good reason
to know, that the young lady who learns thrift in domestic economy is
also learning thrift of the very highest faculties of her immortal spirit.&nbsp;
He will tell you, I doubt not&mdash;for he must know&mdash;how you may
see in Germany young ladies living in what we more luxurious British
would consider something like poverty; cooking, waiting at table, and
performing many a household office which would be here considered menial;
and yet finding time for a cultivation of the intellect, which is, unfortunately,
too rare in Great Britain.</p>
<p>The truth is, that we British are too wealthy.&nbsp; We make money,
if not too rapidly for the good of the nation at large, yet too rapidly,
I fear, for the good of the daughters of those who make it.&nbsp; Their
temptation&mdash;I do not, of course, say they all yield to it&mdash;but
their temptation is, to waste of the very simplest&mdash;I had almost
said, if I may be pardoned the expression, of the most barbaric&mdash;kind;
to an oriental waste of money, and waste of time; to a fondness for
mere finery, pardonable enough, but still a waste; and to the mistaken
fancy that it is the mark of a lady to sit idle and let servants do
everything for her.</p>
<p>Such women may well take a lesson by contrast from the pure and noble,
useful and cultivated thrift of an average German young lady&mdash;for
ladies these German women are, in every possible sense of the word.</p>
<p>But it is not of this sort of waste of which I wish to speak to-day.&nbsp;
I only mention the matter in passing, to show that high intellectual
culture is not incompatible with the performance of homely household
duties, and that the moral success of which I spoke just now need not
be injured, any more than it is in Germany, by intellectual success
likewise.&nbsp; I trust that these words may reassure those parents,
if any such there be here, who may fear that these lectures will withdraw
women from their existing sphere of interest and activity.&nbsp; That
they should entertain such a fear is not surprising, after the extravagant
opinions and schemes which have been lately broached in various quarters.</p>
<p>The programme to these lectures expressly disclaims any such intentions;
and I, as a husband and a father, expressly disclaim any such intention
likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To fit women for the more enlightened performance of their
special duties;&rdquo; to help them towards learning how to do better
what we doubt not they are already doing well; is, I honestly believe,
the only object of the promoters of this scheme.</p>
<p>Let us see now how some of these special duties can be better performed
by help of a little enlightenment as to the laws which regulate them.</p>
<p>Now, no man will deny&mdash;certainly no man who is past forty-five,
and whose digestion is beginning to quail before the lumps of beef and
mutton which are the boast of a British kitchen, and to prefer, with
Justice Shallow, and, I presume, Sir John Falstaff also, &ldquo;any
pretty little tiny kickshaws&rdquo;&mdash;no man, I say, who has reached
that age, but will feel it a practical comfort to him to know that the
young ladies of his family are at all events good cooks; and understand,
as the French do, thrift in the matter of food.</p>
<p>Neither will any parent who wishes, naturally enough, that his daughters
should cost him as little as possible; and wishes, naturally enough
also, that they should be as well dressed as possible, deny that it
would be a good thing for them to be practical milliners and mantua-makers;
and, by making their own clothes gracefully and well, exercise thrift
in clothing.</p>
<p>But, beside this thrift in clothing, I am not alone, I believe, in
wishing for some thrift in the energy which produces it.&nbsp; Labour
misapplied, you will agree, is labour wasted; and as dress, I presume,
is intended to adorn the person of the wearer, the making a dress which
only disfigures her may be considered as a plain case of waste.&nbsp;
It would be impertinent in me to go into any details: but it is impossible
to walk about the streets now without passing young people who must
be under a deep delusion as to the success of their own toilette.&nbsp;
Instead of graceful and noble simplicity of form, instead of combinations
of colour at once rich and delicate, because in accordance with the
chromatic laws of nature, one meets with phenomena more and more painful
to the eye, and startling to common sense, till one would be hardly
more astonished, and certainly hardly more shocked, if in a year or
two one should pass some one going about like a Chinese lady, with pinched
feet, or like a savage of the Amazons, with a wooden bung through her
lower lip.&nbsp; It is easy to complain of these monstrosities: but
impossible to cure them, it seems to me, without an education of the
taste, an education in those laws of nature which produce beauty in
form and beauty in colour.&nbsp; For that the cause of these failures
lies in want of education is patent.&nbsp; They are most common in&mdash;I
had almost said they are confined to&mdash;those classes of well-to-do
persons who are the least educated; who have no standard of taste of
their own; and who do not acquire any from cultivated friends and relations:
who, in consequence, dress themselves blindly according to what they
conceive to be the Paris fashions, conveyed at third-hand through an
equally uneducated dressmaker; in innocent ignorance of the fact&mdash;for
fact I believe it to be&mdash;that Paris fashions are invented now not
in the least for the sake of beauty, but for the sake of producing,
through variety, increased expenditure, and thereby increased employment;
according to the strange system which now prevails in France of compelling,
if not prosperity, at least the signs of it; and like schoolboys before
a holiday, nailing up the head of the weather glass to insure fine weather.</p>
<p>Let British ladies educate themselves in those laws of beauty which
are as eternal as any other of nature&rsquo;s laws; which may be seen
fulfilled, as Mr. Ruskin tells us, so eloquently in every flower and
every leaf, in every sweeping down and rippling wave: and they will
be able to invent graceful and economical dresses for themselves, without
importing tawdry and expensive ugliness from France.</p>
<p>Let me now go a step further, and ask you to consider this.&mdash;There
are in England now a vast number, and an increasing number, of young
women who, from various circumstances which we all know, must in after
life be either the mistresses of their own fortunes, or the earners
of their own bread.&nbsp; And, to do that wisely and well, they must
be more or less women of business; and to be women of business, they
must know something of the meaning of the words capital, profit, price,
value, labour, wages, and of the relation between those two last.&nbsp;
In a word, they must know a little political economy.&nbsp; Nay, I sometimes
think that the mistress of every household might find, not only thrift
of money, but thrift of brain; freedom from mistakes, anxieties, worries
of many kinds, all of which eat out the health as well as the heart,
by a little sound knowledge of the principles of political economy.</p>
<p>When we consider that every mistress of a household is continually
buying, if not selling; that she is continually hiring and employing
labour in the form of servants; and very often, into the bargain, keeping
her husband&rsquo;s accounts: I cannot but think that her hard-worked
brain might be clearer, and her hard-tried desire to do her duty by
every subject in her little kingdom, might be more easily satisfied,
had she read something of what Mr. John Stuart Mill has written, especially
on the duties of employer and employed.&nbsp; A capitalist, a commercialist,
an employer of labour, and an accountant&mdash;every mistress of a household
is all these, whether she likes it or not; and it would be surely well
for her, in so very complicated a state of society as this, not to trust
merely to that mother-wit, that intuitive sagacity and innate power
of ruling her fellow-creatures, which carries women so nobly through
their work in simpler and less civilised societies.</p>
<p>And here I stop to answer those who may say&mdash;as I have heard
it said&mdash;That a woman&rsquo;s intellect is not fit for business;
that when a woman takes to business, she is apt to do it ill, and unpleasantly
likewise; to be more suspicious, more irritable, more grasping, more
unreasonable, than regular men of business would be; that&mdash;as I
have heard it put&mdash;&ldquo;a woman does not fight fair.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The answer is simple.&nbsp; That a woman&rsquo;s intellect is eminently
fitted for business is proved by the enormous amount of business she
gets through without any special training for it: but those faults in
a woman of which some men complain are simply the results of her not
having had a special training.&nbsp; She does not know the laws of business.&nbsp;
She does not know the rules of the game she is playing; and therefore
she is playing it in the dark, in fear and suspicion, apt to judge of
questions on personal grounds, often offending those with whom she has
to do, and oftener still making herself miserable over matters of law
or of business, on which a little sound knowledge would set her head
and her heart at rest.</p>
<p>When I have seen widows, having the care of children, of a great
household, of a great estate, of a great business, struggling heroically,
and yet often mistakenly; blamed severely for selfishness and ambition,
while they were really sacrificing themselves with the divine instinct
of a mother for their children&rsquo;s interest: I have stood by with
mingled admiration and pity, and said to myself&mdash;&ldquo;How nobly
she is doing the work without teaching!&nbsp; How much more nobly would
she have done it had she been taught!&nbsp; She is now doing the work
at the most enormous waste of energy and of virtue: had she had knowledge,
thrift would have followed it; she would have done more work with far
less trouble.&nbsp; She will probably kill herself if she goes on: sound
knowledge would have saved her health, saved her heart, saved her friends,
and helped the very loved ones for whom she labours, not always with
success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little political economy, therefore, will at least do no harm to
a woman; especially if she have to take care of herself in after life;
neither, I think, will she be much harmed by some sound knowledge of
another subject, which I see promised in these lectures,&mdash;&ldquo;Natural
philosophy, in its various branches, such as the chemistry of common
life, light, heat, electricity, &amp;c., &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little knowledge of the laws of light, for instance, would teach
many women that by shutting themselves up day after day, week after
week, in darkened rooms, they are as certainly committing a waste of
health, destroying their vital energy, and diseasing their brains, as
if they were taking so much poison the whole time.</p>
<p>A little knowledge of the laws of heat would teach women not to clothe
themselves and their children after foolish and insufficient fashions,
which in this climate sow the seeds of a dozen different diseases, and
have to be atoned for by perpetual anxieties, and by perpetual doctors&rsquo;
bills; and as for a little knowledge of the laws of electricity, one
thrift I am sure it would produce&mdash;thrift to us men, of having
to answer continual inquiries as to what the weather is going to be,
when a slight knowledge of the barometer, or of the form of the clouds
and the direction of the wind, would enable many a lady to judge for
herself, and not, after inquiry on inquiry, disregard all warnings,
go out on the first appearance of a strip of blue sky, and come home
wet through, with what she calls &ldquo;only a chill,&rdquo; but which
really means a nail driven into her coffin&mdash;a probable shortening,
though it may be a very small one, of her mortal life; because the food
of the next twenty-four hours, which should have gone to keep the vital
heat at its normal standard, will have to be wasted in raising it up
to that standard, from which it has fallen by a chill.</p>
<p>Ladies; these are subjects on which I must beg to speak a little
more at length, premising them by one statement, which may seem jest,
but is solemn earnest&mdash;that, if the medical men of this or any
other city were what the world now calls &ldquo;alive to their own interests&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, to the mere making of money; instead of being, what medical men
are, the most generous, disinterested, and high-minded class in these
realms, then they would oppose by all means in their power the delivery
of lectures on natural philosophy to women.&nbsp; For if women act upon
what they learn in those lectures&mdash;and having women&rsquo;s hearts,
they will act upon it&mdash;there ought to follow a decrease of sickness
and an increase of health, especially among children; a thrift of life,
and a thrift of expense besides, which would very seriously affect the
income of medical men.</p>
<p>For let me ask you, ladies, with all courtesy, but with all earnestness&mdash;Are
you aware of certain facts, of which every one of those excellent medical
men is too well aware?&nbsp; Are you aware that more human beings are
killed in England every year by unnecessary and preventable diseases
than were killed at Waterloo or at Sadowa?&nbsp; Are you aware that
the great majority of those victims are children?&nbsp; Are you aware
that the diseases which carry them off are for the most part such as
ought to be specially under the control of the women who love them,
pet them, educate them, and would in many cases, if need be, lay down
their lives for them?&nbsp; Are you aware, again, of the vast amount
of disease which, so both wise mothers and wise doctors assure me, is
engendered in the sleeping-room from simple ignorance of the laws of
ventilation, and in the school-room likewise, from simple ignorance
of the laws of physiology? from an ignorance of which I shall mention
no other case here save one&mdash;that too often from ignorance of signs
of approaching disease, a child is punished for what is called idleness,
listlessness, wilfulness, sulkiness; and punished, too, in the unwisest
way&mdash;by an increase of tasks and confinement to the house, thus
overtasking still more a brain already overtasked, and depressing still
more, by robbing it of oxygen and of exercise, a system already depressed?&nbsp;
Are you aware, I ask again, of all this?&nbsp; I speak earnestly upon
this point, because I speak with experience.&nbsp; As a single instance:
a medical man, a friend of mine, passing by his own school-room, heard
one of his own little girls screaming and crying, and went in.&nbsp;
The governess, an excellent woman, but wholly ignorant of the laws of
physiology, complained that the child had of late become obstinate and
would not learn; and that therefore she must punish her by keeping her
indoors over the unlearnt lessons.&nbsp; The father, who knew that the
child was usually a very good one, looked at her carefully for a little
while; sent her out of the school-room; and then said, &ldquo;That child
must not open a book for a month.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had not acted
so,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;I should have had that child dead of
brain-disease within the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, in the face of such facts as these, is it too much to ask of
mothers, sisters, aunts, nurses, governesses&mdash;all who may be occupied
in the care of children, especially of girls&mdash;that they should
study thrift of human health and human life, by studying somewhat the
laws of life and health?&nbsp; There are books&mdash;I may say a whole
literature of books&mdash;written by scientific doctors on these matters,
which are in my mind far more important to the school-room than half
the trashy accomplishments, so-called, which are expected to be known
by governesses.&nbsp; But are they bought?&nbsp; Are they even to be
bought, from most country booksellers?&nbsp; Ah, for a little knowledge
of the laws to the neglect of which is owing so much fearful disease,
which, if it does not produce immediate death, too often leaves the
constitution impaired for years to come.&nbsp; Ah the waste of health
and strength in the young; the waste, too, of anxiety and misery in
those who love and tend them.&nbsp; How much of it might be saved by
a little rational education in those laws of nature which are the will
of God about the welfare of our bodies, and which, therefore, we are
as much bound to know and to obey, as we are bound to know and obey
the spiritual laws whereon depends the welfare of our souls.</p>
<p>Pardon me, ladies, if I have given a moment&rsquo;s pain to any one
here: but I appeal to every medical man in the room whether I have not
spoken the truth; and having such an opportunity as this, I felt that
I must speak for the sake of children, and of women likewise, or else
for ever hereafter hold my peace.</p>
<p>Let me pass on from this painful subject&mdash;for painful it has
been to me for many years&mdash;to a question of intellectual thrift&mdash;by
which I mean just now thrift of words; thrift of truth; restraint of
the tongue; accuracy and modesty in statement.</p>
<p>Mothers complain to me that girls are apt to be&mdash;not intentionally
untruthful&mdash;but exaggerative, prejudiced, incorrect, in repeating
a conversation or describing an event; and that from this fault arise,
as is to be expected, misunderstandings, quarrels, rumours, slanders,
scandals, and what not.</p>
<p>Now, for this waste of words there is but one cure: and if I be told
that it is a natural fault of women; that they cannot take the calm
judicial view of matters which men boast, and often boast most wrongly,
that they can take; that under the influence of hope, fear, delicate
antipathy, honest moral indignation, they will let their eyes and ears
be governed by their feelings; and see and hear only what they wish
to see and hear: I answer, that it is not for me as a man to start such
a theory; but that if it be true, it is an additional argument for some
education which will correct this supposed natural defect.&nbsp; And
I say deliberately that there is but one sort of education which will
correct it; one which will teach young women to observe facts accurately,
judge them calmly, and describe them carefully, without adding or distorting:
and that is, some training in natural science.</p>
<p>I beg you not to be startled: but if you are, then test the truth
of my theory by playing to-night at the game called &ldquo;Russian Scandal;&rdquo;
in which a story, repeated in secret by one player to the other, comes
out at the end of the game, owing to the inaccurate and&mdash;forgive
me if I say it&mdash;uneducated brains through which it has passed,
utterly unlike its original; not only ludicrously maimed and distorted,
but often with the most fantastic additions of events, details, names,
dates, places, which each player will aver that he received from the
player before him.&nbsp; I am afraid that too much of the average gossip
of every city, town, and village is little more than a game of &ldquo;Russian
Scandal;&rdquo; with this difference, that while one is but a game,
the other is but too mischievous earnest.</p>
<p>But now, if among your party there shall be an average lawyer, medical
man, or man of science, you will find that he, and perhaps he alone,
will be able to retail accurately the story which has been told him.&nbsp;
And why?&nbsp; Simply because his mind has been trained to deal with
facts; to ascertain exactly what he does see or hear, and to imprint
its leading features strongly and clearly on his memory.</p>
<p>Now, you certainly cannot make young ladies barristers or attorneys;
nor employ their brains in getting up cases, civil or criminal; and
as for chemistry, they and their parents may have a reasonable antipathy
to smells, blackened fingers, and occasional explosions and poisonings.&nbsp;
But you may make them something of botanists, zoologists, geologists.</p>
<p>I could say much on this point: allow me at least to say this: I
verily believe that any young lady who would employ some of her leisure
time in collecting wild flowers, carefully examining them, verifying
them, and arranging them; or who would in her summer trip to the sea-coast
do the same by the common objects of the shore, instead of wasting her
holiday, as one sees hundreds doing, in lounging on benches on the esplanade,
reading worthless novels, and criticizing dresses&mdash;that such a
young lady, I say, would not only open her own mind to a world of wonder,
beauty, and wisdom, which, if it did not make her a more reverent and
pious soul, she cannot be the woman which I take for granted she is;
but would save herself from the habit&mdash;I had almost said the necessity&mdash;of
gossip; because she would have things to think of and not merely persons;
facts instead of fancies; while she would acquire something of accuracy,
of patience, of methodical observation and judgment, which would stand
her in good stead in the events of daily life, and increase her power
of bridling her tongue and her imagination.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is in heaven,
and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few;&rdquo; is the lesson
which those are learning all day long who study the works of God with
reverent accuracy, lest by misrepresenting them they should be tempted
to say that God has done that which He has not; and in that wholesome
discipline I long that women as well as men should share.</p>
<p>And now I come to a thrift of the highest kind, as contrasted with
a waste the most deplorable and ruinous of all; thrift of those faculties
which connect us with the unseen and spiritual world; with humanity,
with Christ, with God; thrift of the immortal spirit.&nbsp; I am not
going now to give you a sermon on duty.&nbsp; You hear such, I doubt
not, in church every Sunday, far better than I can preach to you.&nbsp;
I am going to speak rather of thrift of the heart, thrift of the emotions.&nbsp;
How they are wasted in these days in reading what are called sensation
novels, all know but too well; how British literature&mdash;all that
the best hearts and intellects among our forefathers have bequeathed
to us&mdash;is neglected for light fiction, the reading of which is,
as a lady well said, &ldquo;the worst form of intemperance&mdash;dram-drinking
and opium-eating, intellectual and moral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that the young will delight&mdash;they have delighted in all
ages, and will to the end of time&mdash;in fictions which deal with
that &ldquo;oldest tale which is for ever new.&rdquo;&nbsp; Novels will
be read: but that is all the more reason why women should be trained,
by the perusal of a higher, broader, deeper literature, to distinguish
the good novel from the bad, the moral from the immoral, the noble from
the base, the true work of art from the sham which hides its shallowness
and vulgarity under a tangled plot and melodramatic situations.&nbsp;
She should learn&mdash;and that she can only learn by cultivation&mdash;to
discern with joy, and drink in with reverence, the good, the beautiful,
and the true; and to turn with the fine scorn of a pure and strong womanhood
from the bad, the ugly, and the false.</p>
<p>And if any parent should be inclined to reply&mdash;&ldquo;Why lay
so much stress upon educating a girl in British literature?&nbsp; Is
it not far more important to make our daughters read religious books?&rdquo;&nbsp;
I answer&mdash;Of course it is.&nbsp; I take for granted that that is
done in a Christian land.&nbsp; But I beg you to recollect that there
are books and books; and that in these days of a free press it is impossible,
in the long run, to prevent girls reading books of very different shades
of opinion, and very different religious worth.&nbsp; It may be, therefore,
of the very highest importance to a girl to have her intellect, her
taste, her emotions, her moral sense, in a word, her whole womanhood,
so cultivated and regulated that she shall herself be able to discern
the true from the false, the orthodox from the unorthodox, the truly
devout from the merely sentimental, the Gospel from its counterfeits.</p>
<p>I should have thought that there never had been in Britain, since
the Reformation, a crisis at which young Englishwomen required more
careful cultivation on these matters; if at least they are to be saved
from making themselves and their families miserable; and from ending&mdash;as
I have known too many end&mdash;with broken hearts, broken brains, broken
health, and an early grave.</p>
<p>Take warning by what you see abroad.&nbsp; In every country where
the women are uneducated, unoccupied; where their only literature is
French novels or translations of them&mdash;in every one of those countries
the women, even to the highest, are the slaves of superstition, and
the puppets of priests.&nbsp; In proportion as, in certain other countries&mdash;notably,
I will say, in Scotland&mdash;the women are highly educated, family
life and family secrets are sacred, and the woman owns allegiance and
devotion to no confessor or director, but to her own husband or to her
own family.</p>
<p>I say plainly, that if any parents wish their daughters to succumb
at last to some quackery or superstition, whether calling itself scientific,
or calling itself religious&mdash;and there are too many of both just
now&mdash;they cannot more certainly effect their purpose than by allowing
her to grow up ignorant, frivolous, luxurious, vain; with her emotions
excited, but not satisfied, by the reading of foolish and even immoral
novels.</p>
<p>In such a case the more delicate and graceful the organization, the
more noble and earnest the nature, which has been neglected, the more
certain it is&mdash;I know too well what I am saying&mdash;to go astray.</p>
<p>The time of depression, disappointment, vacuity, all but despair,
must come.&nbsp; The immortal spirit, finding no healthy satisfaction
for its highest aspirations, is but too likely to betake itself to an
unhealthy and exciting superstition.&nbsp; Ashamed of its own long self-indulgence,
it is but too likely to flee from itself into a morbid asceticism.&nbsp;
Not having been taught its God-given and natural duties in the world,
it is but too likely to betake itself, from the mere craving for action,
to self-invented and unnatural duties out of the world.&nbsp; Ignorant
of true science, yet craving to understand the wonders of nature and
of spirit, it is but too likely to betake itself to nonscience&mdash;nonsense
as it is usually called&mdash;whether of spirit-rapping and mesmerism,
or of miraculous relics and winking pictures.&nbsp; Longing for guidance
and teaching, and never having been taught to guide and teach itself,
it is but too likely to deliver itself up in self-despair to the guidance
and teaching of those who, whether they be quacks or fanatics, look
on uneducated women as their natural prey.</p>
<p>You will see, I am sure, from what I have said, that it is not my
wish that you should become mere learned women; mere female pedants,
as useless and unpleasing as male pedants are wont to be.&nbsp; The
education which I set before you is not to be got by mere hearing lectures
or reading books: for it is an education of your whole character; a
self-education; which really means a committing of yourself to God,
that He may educate you.&nbsp; Hearing lectures is good, for it will
teach you how much there is to be known, and how little you know.&nbsp;
Reading books is good, for it will give you habits of regular and diligent
study.&nbsp; And therefore I urge on you strongly private study, especially
in case a library should be formed here of books on those most practical
subjects of which I have been speaking.&nbsp; But, after all, both lectures
and books are good, mainly in as far as they furnish matter for reflection:
while the desire to reflect and the ability to reflect must come, as
I believe, from above.&nbsp; The honest craving after light and power,
after knowledge, wisdom, active usefulness, must come&mdash;and may
it come to you&mdash;by the inspiration of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>One word more, and I have done.&nbsp; Let me ask women to educate
themselves, not for their own sakes merely, but for the sake of others.&nbsp;
For, whether they will or not, they must educate others.&nbsp; I do
not speak merely of those who may be engaged in the work of direct teaching;
that they ought to be well taught themselves, who can doubt?&nbsp; I
speak of those&mdash;and in so doing I speak of every woman, young and
old&mdash;who exercises as wife, as mother, as aunt, as sister, or as
friend, an influence, indirect it may be, and unconscious, but still
potent and practical, on the minds and characters of those about them,
especially of men.&nbsp; How potent and practical that influence is,
those know best who know most of the world and most of human nature.&nbsp;
There are those who consider&mdash;and I agree with them&mdash;that
the education of boys under the age of twelve years ought to be entrusted
as much as possible to women.&nbsp; Let me ask&mdash;of what period
of youth and of manhood does not the same hold true?&nbsp; I pity the
ignorance and conceit of the man who fancies that he has nothing left
to learn from cultivated women.&nbsp; I should have thought that the
very mission of woman was to be, in the highest sense, the educator
of man from infancy to old age; that that was the work towards which
all the God-given capacities of women pointed; for which they were to
be educated to the highest pitch.&nbsp; I should have thought that it
was the glory of woman that she was sent into the world to live for
others, rather than for herself; and therefore I should say&mdash;Let
her smallest rights be respected, her smallest wrongs redressed: but
let her never be persuaded to forget that she is sent into the world
to teach man&mdash;what, I believe, she has been teaching him all along,
even in the savage state&mdash;namely, that there is something more
necessary than the claiming of rights, and that is, the performing of
duties; to teach him specially, in these so-called intellectual days,
that there is something more than intellect, and that is&mdash;purity
and virtue.&nbsp; Let her never be persuaded to forget that her calling
is not the lower and more earthly one of self-assertion, but the higher
and the diviner calling of self-sacrifice; and let her never desert
that higher life, which lives in others and for others, like her Redeemer
and her Lord.</p>
<p>And if any should answer that this doctrine would keep woman a dependant
and a slave, I rejoin&mdash;Not so: it would keep her what she should
be&mdash;the mistress of all around her, because mistress of herself.&nbsp;
And more, I should express a fear that those who made that answer had
not yet seen into the mystery of true greatness and true strength; that
they did not yet understand the true magnanimity, the true royalty of
that spirit, by which the Son of man came not to be ministered unto,
but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.</p>
<p>Surely that is woman&rsquo;s calling&mdash;to teach man: and to teach
him what?&nbsp; To teach him, after all, that his calling is the same
as hers, if he will but see the things which belong to his peace.&nbsp;
To temper his fiercer, coarser, more self-assertive nature, by the contact
of her gentleness, purity, self-sacrifice.&nbsp; To make him see that
not by blare of trumpets, not by noise, wrath, greed, ambition, intrigue,
puffery, is good and lasting work to be done on earth: but by wise self-distrust,
by silent labour, by lofty self-control, by that charity which hopeth
all things, believeth all things, endureth all things; by such an example,
in short, as women now in tens of thousands set to those around them;
such as they will show more and more, the more their whole womanhood
is educated to employ its powers without waste and without haste in
harmonious unity.&nbsp; Let the woman begin in girlhood, if such be
her happy lot&mdash;to quote the words of a great poet, a great philosopher,
and a great Churchman, William Wordsworth&mdash;let her begin, I say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With all things round about her drawn<br />
From May-time and the cheerful dawn;<br />
A dancing shape, an image gay,<br />
To haunt, to startle, and waylay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let her develop onwards&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A spirit, yet a woman too,<br />
With household motions light and free,<br />
And steps of virgin liberty.<br />
A countenance in which shall meet<br />
Sweet records, promises as sweet;<br />
A creature not too bright and good<br />
For human nature&rsquo;s daily food;<br />
For transient sorrows, simple wiles,<br />
Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let her highest and her final development be that which not nature,
but self-education alone can bring&mdash;that which makes her once and
for ever&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A being breathing thoughtful breath;<br />
A traveller betwixt life and death.<br />
With reason firm, with temperate will,<br />
Endurance, foresight, strength and skill.<br />
A perfect woman, nobly planned,<br />
To warn, to comfort and command.<br />
And yet a spirit still and bright<br />
With something of an angel light.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>THE STUDY OF NATURAL HISTORY.<br />
A LECTURE DELIVERED TO THE OFFICERS OF THE ROYAL ARTILLERY, WOOLWICH.</h2>
<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;When I accepted the honour of lecturing here, I
took for granted that so select an audience would expect from me not
mere amusement, but somewhat of instruction; or, if that be too ambitious
a word for me to use, at least some fresh hint&mdash;if I were able
to give one&mdash;as to how they should fulfil the ideal of military
men in such an age as this.</p>
<p>To touch on military matters, even had I been conversant with them,
seemed to me an impertinence.&nbsp; I am bound to take for granted that
every man knows his own business best; and I incline more and more to
the opinion that military men should be left to work out the problems
of their art for themselves, without the advice or criticism of civilians.&nbsp;
But I hold&mdash;and I am sure that you will agree with me&mdash;that
if the soldier is to be thus trusted by the nation, and left to himself
to do his own work his own way, he must be educated in all practical
matters as highly as the average of educated civilians.&nbsp; He must
know all that they know, and his own art beside.&nbsp; Just as a clergyman,
being a man plus a priest, is bound to be a man, and a good man, over
and above his priesthood, so is the soldier bound to be a civilian,
and a highly-educated civilian, plus his soldierly qualities and acquirements.</p>
<p>It seemed to me, therefore, that I might, without impertinence, ask
you to consider a branch of knowledge which is becoming yearly more
and more important in the eyes of well-educated civilians; of which,
therefore, the soldier ought at least to know something, in order to
put him on a par with the general intelligence of the nation.&nbsp;
I do not say that he is to devote much time to it, or to follow it up
into specialities: but that he ought to be well grounded in its principles
and methods; that he ought to be aware of its importance and its usefulness;
that so, if he comes into contact&mdash;as he will more and more&mdash;with
scientific men, he may understand them, respect them, befriend them,
and be befriended by them in turn; and how desirable this last result
is, I shall tell you hereafter.</p>
<p>There are those, I doubt not, among my audience who do not need the
advice which I shall presume to give to-night; who belong to that fast
increasing class among officers of whom I have often said&mdash;and
I have found scientific men cordially agree with me&mdash;that they
are the most modest and the most teachable of men.&nbsp; But even in
their case there can be no harm in going over deliberately a question
of such importance; in putting it, as it were, into shape; and insisting
on arguments which may perhaps not have occurred to some of them.</p>
<p>Let me, in the first place, reassure those&mdash;if any such there
be&mdash;who may suppose, from the title of my lecture, that I am only
going to recommend them to collect weeds and butterflies, &ldquo;rats
and mice, and such small deer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; The honourable
title of Natural History has, and unwisely, been restricted too much
of late years to the mere study of plants and animals.&nbsp; I desire
to restore the words to their original and proper meaning&mdash;the
History of Nature; that is, of all that is born, and grows in time;
in short, of all natural objects.</p>
<p>If anyone shall say&mdash;By that definition you make not only geology
and chemistry branches of natural history, but meteorology and astronomy
likewise&mdash;I cannot deny it.&nbsp; They deal, each of them, with
realms of Nature.&nbsp; Geology is, literally, the natural history of
soils and lands; chemistry the natural history of compounds, organic
and inorganic; meteorology the natural history of climates; astronomy
the natural history of planetary and solar bodies.&nbsp; And more, you
cannot now study deeply any branch of what is popularly called Natural
History&mdash;that is, plants and animals&mdash;without finding it necessary
to learn something, and more and more as you go deeper, of those very
sciences.&nbsp; As the marvellous interdependence of all natural objects
and forces unfolds itself more and more, so the once separate sciences,
which treated of different classes of natural objects, are forced to
interpenetrate, as it were; and to supplement themselves by knowledge
borrowed from each other.&nbsp; Thus&mdash;to give a single instance&mdash;no
man can now be a first-rate botanist unless he be also no mean meteorologist,
no mean geologist, and&mdash;as Mr. Darwin has shown in his extraordinary
discoveries about the fertilisation of plants by insects&mdash;no mean
entomologist likewise.</p>
<p>It is difficult, therefore, and indeed somewhat unwise and unfair,
to put any limit to the term Natural History, save that it shall deal
only with nature and with matter; and shall not pretend&mdash;as some
would have it to do just now&mdash;to go out of its own sphere to meddle
with moral and spiritual matters.&nbsp; But, for practical purposes,
we may define the natural history of any given spot as the history of
the causes which have made it what it is, and filled it with the natural
objects which it holds.&nbsp; And if anyone would know how to study
the natural history of a place, and how to write it, let him read&mdash;and
if he has read its delightful pages in youth, read once again&mdash;that
hitherto unrivalled little monograph, White&rsquo;s &lsquo;Natural History
of Selborne;&rsquo; and let him then try, by the light of improved science,
to do for any district where he may be stationed, what White did for
Selborne nearly one hundred years ago.&nbsp; Let him study its plants,
its animals, its soils and rocks; and last, but not least, its scenery,
as the total outcome of what the soils, and plants, and animals have
made it.&nbsp; I say, have made it.&nbsp; How far the nature of the
soils and the rocks will affect the scenery of a district may be well
learnt from a very clever and interesting little book of Professor Geikie&rsquo;s,
on &lsquo;The Scenery of Scotland, as affected by its Geological Structure.&rsquo;&nbsp;
How far the plants and trees affect not merely the general beauty, the
richness or barrenness of a country, but also its very shape; the rate
at which the hills are destroyed and washed into the lowland; the rate
at which the seaboard is being removed by the action of waves&mdash;all
these are branches of study which is becoming more and more important.</p>
<p>And even in the study of animals and their effects on the vegetation,
questions of really deep interest will arise.&nbsp; You will find that
certain plants and trees cannot thrive in a district, while others can,
because the former are browsed down by cattle, or their seeds eaten
by birds, and the latter are not; that certain seeds are carried in
the coats of animals, or wafted abroad by winds&mdash;others are not;
certain trees destroyed wholesale by insects, while others are not;
that in a hundred ways the animal and vegetable life of a district act
and react upon each other, and that the climate, the average temperature,
the maximum and minimum temperatures, the rainfall, act on them, and
in the case of the vegetation, are reacted on again by them.&nbsp; The
diminution of rainfall by the destruction of forests, its increase by
replanting them, and the effect of both on the healthiness or unhealthiness
of a place&mdash;as in the case of the Mauritius, where a once healthy
island has become pestilential, seemingly from the clearing away of
the vegetation on the banks of streams&mdash;all this, though to study
it deeply requires a fair knowledge of meteorology, and even of a science
or two more, is surely well worth the attention of any educated man
who is put in charge of the health and lives of human beings.</p>
<p>You will surely agree with me that the habit of mind required for
such a study as this, is the very same as is required for successful
military study.&nbsp; In fact, I should say that the same intellect
which would develop into a great military man, would develop also into
a great naturalist.&nbsp; I say, intellect.&nbsp; The military man would
require&mdash;what the naturalist would not&mdash;over and above his
intellect, a special force of will, in order to translate his theories
into fact, and make his campaigns in the field and not merely on paper.&nbsp;
But I am speaking only of the habit of mind required for study; of that
inductive habit of mind which works, steadily and by rule, from the
known to the unknown; that habit of mind of which it has been said:&mdash;&ldquo;The
habit of seeing; the habit of knowing what we see; the habit of discerning
differences and likenesses; the habit of classifying accordingly; the
habit of searching for hypotheses which shall connect and explain those
classified facts; the habit of verifying these hypotheses by applying
them to fresh facts; the habit of throwing them away bravely if they
will not fit; the habit of general patience, diligence, accuracy, reverence
for facts for their own sake, and love of truth for its own sake; in
one word, the habit of reverent and implicit obedience to the laws of
Nature, whatever they may be&mdash;these are not merely intellectual,
but also moral habits, which will stand men in practical good stead
in every affair of life, and in every question, even the most awful,
which may come before them as rational and social beings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And specially valuable are they, surely, to the military man, the very
essence of whose study, to be successful, lies first in continuous and
accurate observation, and then in calm and judicious arrangement.</p>
<p>Therefore it is that I hold, and hold strongly, that the study of
physical science, far from interfering with an officer&rsquo;s studies,
much less unfitting for them, must assist him in them, by keeping his
mind always in the very attitude and the very temper which they require.&nbsp;
If any smile at this theory of mine, let them recollect one curious
fact: that perhaps the greatest captain of the old world was trained
by perhaps the greatest philosopher of the old world&mdash;the father
of Natural History; that Aristotle was the tutor of Alexander of Macedon.&nbsp;
I do not fancy, of course, that Aristotle taught Alexander any Natural
History.&nbsp; But this we know, that he taught him to use those very
faculties by which Aristotle became a natural historian, and many things
beside; that he called out in his pupil somewhat of his own extraordinary
powers of observation, extraordinary powers of arrangement.&nbsp; He
helped to make him a great general: but he helped to make him more&mdash;a
great politician, coloniser, discoverer.&nbsp; He instilled into him
such a sense of the importance of Natural History, that Alexander helped
him nobly in his researches; and, if Athen&aelig;us is to be believed,
gave him 800 talents towards perfecting his history of animals.&nbsp;
Surely it is not too much to say that this close friendship between
the natural philosopher and the soldier has changed the whole course
of civilisation to this very day.&nbsp; Do not consider me Utopian when
I tell you, that I should like to see the study of physical science
an integral part of the curriculum of every military school.&nbsp; I
would train the mind of the lad who was to become hereafter an officer
in the army&mdash;and in the navy like wise&mdash;by accustoming him
to careful observation of, and sound thought about, the face of nature;
of the commonest objects under his feet, just as much as of the stars
above his head; provided always that he learnt, not at second-hand from
books, but where alone he can really learn either war or nature&mdash;in
the field; by actual observation, actual experiment.&nbsp; A laboratory
for chemical experiment is a good thing, it is true, as far as it goes;
but I should prefer to the laboratory a naturalists&rsquo; field club,
such as are prospering now at several of the best public schools, certain
that the boys would get more of sound inductive habits of mind, as well
as more health, manliness, and cheerfulness, amid scenes to remember
which will be a joy for ever, than they ever can by bending over retorts
and crucibles, amid smells even to remember which is a pain for ever.</p>
<p>But I would, whether a field club existed or not, require of every
young man entering the army or navy&mdash;indeed of every young man
entering any liberal profession whatsoever&mdash;a fair knowledge, such
as would enable him to pass an examination, in what the Germans call
<i>Erd-kunde</i>&mdash;earth-lore&mdash;in that knowledge of the face
of the earth and of its products, for which we English have as yet cared
so little that we have actually no English name for it, save the clumsy
and questionable one of physical geography; and, I am sorry to say,
hardly any readable school books about it, save Keith Johnston&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Physical Atlas&rsquo;&mdash;an acquaintance with which last I
should certainly require of young men.</p>
<p>It does seem most strange&mdash;or rather will seem most strange
100 years hence&mdash;that we, the nation of colonists, the nation of
sailors, the nation of foreign commerce, the nation of foreign military
stations, the nation of travellers for travelling&rsquo;s sake, the
nation of which one man here and another there&mdash;as Schleiden sets
forth in his book, &lsquo;The Plant,&rsquo; in a charming ideal conversation
at the Travellers&rsquo; Club&mdash;has seen and enjoyed more of the
wonders and beauties of this planet than the men of any nation, not
even excepting the Germans&mdash;that this nation, I say, should as
yet have done nothing, or all but nothing, to teach in her schools a
knowledge of that planet, of which she needs to know more, and can if
she will know more, than any other nation upon it.</p>
<p>As for the practical utility of such studies to a soldier, I only
need, I trust, to hint at it to such an assembly as this.&nbsp; All
must see of what advantage a rough knowledge of the botany of a district
would be to an officer leading an exploring party, or engaged in bush
warfare.&nbsp; To know what plants are poisonous; what plants, too,
are eatable&mdash;and many more are eatable than is usually supposed;
what plants yield oleaginous substances, whether for food or for other
uses; what plants yield vegetable acids, as preventives of scurvy; what
timbers are available for each of many different purposes; what will
resist wet, salt-water, and the attacks of insects; what, again, can
be used, at a pinch, for medicine or for styptics&mdash;and be sure,
as a wise West Indian doctor once said to me, that there is more good
medicine wild in the bush than there is in all the druggists&rsquo;
shops&mdash;surely all this is a knowledge not beneath the notice of
any enterprising officer, above all of an officer of engineers.&nbsp;
I only ask anyone who thinks that I may be in the right, to glance through
the lists of useful vegetable products given in Lindley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vegetable
Kingdom&rsquo;&mdash;a miracle of learning&mdash;and see the vast field
open still to a thoughtful and observant man, even while on service;
and not to forget that such knowledge, if he should hereafter leave
the service and settle, as many do, in a distant land, may be a solid
help to his future prosperity.&nbsp; So strongly do I feel on this matter,
that I should like to see some knowledge at least of Dr. Oliver&rsquo;s
excellent little &lsquo;First Book of Indian Botany&rsquo; required
of all officers going to our Indian Empire: but as that will not be,
at least for many a year to come, I recommend any gentlemen going to
India to get that book, and wile away the hours of the outward voyage
by acquiring knowledge which will be a continual source of interest,
and it may be now and then of profit, to them during their stay abroad.</p>
<p>And for geology, again.&nbsp; As I do not expect you all, or perhaps
any of you, to become such botanists as General Monro, whose recent
&lsquo;Monograph of the Bamboos&rsquo; is an honour to British botanists,
and a proof of the scientific power which is to be found here and there
among British officers: so I do not expect you to become such geologists
as Sir Roderick Murchison, or even to add such a grand chapter to the
history of extinct animals as Major Cautley did by his discoveries in
the Sewalik Hills.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you can learn&mdash;and I should
earnestly advise you to learn&mdash;geology and mineralogy enough to
be of great use to you in your profession, and of use, too, should you
relinquish your profession hereafter.&nbsp; It must be profitable for
any man, and specially for you, to know how and where to find good limestone,
building stone, road metal; it must be good to be able to distinguish
ores and mineral products; it must be good to know&mdash;as a geologist
will usually know, even in a country which he sees for the first time&mdash;where
water is likely to be found, and at what probable depth; it must be
good to know whether the water is fit for drinking or not, whether it
is unwholesome or merely muddy; it must be good to know what spots are
likely to be healthy, and what unhealthy, for encamping.&nbsp; The two
last questions depend, doubtless, on meteorological as well as geological
accidents: but the answers to them will be most surely found out by
the scientific man, because the facts connected with them are, like
all other facts, determined by natural laws.&nbsp; After what one has
heard, in past years, of barracks built in spots plainly pestilential;
of soldiers encamped in ruined cities, reeking with the dirt and poison
of centuries; of&mdash;but it is not my place to find fault; all I will
say is, that the wise and humane officer, when once his eyes are opened
to the practical value of physical science, will surely try to acquaint
himself somewhat with those laws of drainage and of climate, geological,
meteorological, chemical, which influence, often with terrible suddenness
and fury, the health of whole armies.&nbsp; He will not find it beyond
his province to ascertain the amount and period of rainfalls, the maxima
of heat and of cold which his troops may have to endure, and many another
point on which their health and efficiency&mdash;nay, their very life
may depend, but which are now too exclusively delegated to the doctor,
to whose province they do not really belong.&nbsp; For cure, I take
the liberty of believing, is the duty of the medical officer; prevention,
that of the military.</p>
<p>Thus much I can say just now&mdash;and there is much more to be said&mdash;on
the practical uses of the study of Natural History.&nbsp; But let me
remind you, on the other side, if Natural History will help you, you
in return can help her; and would, I doubt not, help her, and help scientific
men at home, if once you looked fairly and steadily at the immense importance
of Natural History&mdash;of the knowledge of the &ldquo;face of the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe that all will one day feel, more or less,
that to know the earth <i>on</i> which we live, and the laws of it <i>by</i>
which we live, is a sacred duty to ourselves, to our children after
us, and to all whom we may have to command and to influence; aye, and
a duty to God likewise.&nbsp; For is it not a duty of common reverence
and faith towards Him, if He has put us into a beautiful and wonderful
place, and given us faculties by which we can see, and enjoy, and use
that place&mdash;is it not a duty of reverence and faith towards Him
to use these faculties, and to learn the lessons which He has laid open
for us?&nbsp; If you feel that, as I think you all will some day feel,
then you will surely feel likewise that it will be a good deed&mdash;I
do not say a necessary duty, but still a good deed and praiseworthy&mdash;to
help physical science forward; and to add your contributions, however
small, to our general knowledge of the earth.&nbsp; And how much may
be done for science by British officers, especially on foreign stations,
I need not point out.&nbsp; I know that much has been done, chivalrously
and well, by officers; and that men of science owe them, and give them,
hearty thanks for their labours.&nbsp; But I should like, I confess,
to see more done still.&nbsp; I should like to see every foreign station,
what one or two highly-educated officers might easily make it, an advanced
post of physical science, in regular communication with our scientific
societies at home, sending to them accurate and methodic details of
the natural history of each district&mdash;details 99/100ths of which
might seem worthless in the eyes of the public, but which would all
be precious in the eyes of scientific men, who know that no fact is
really unimportant; and more, that while plodding patiently through
seemingly unimportant facts, you may stumble on one of infinite importance,
both scientific and practical.&nbsp; For the student of nature, gentlemen,
if he will be but patient, diligent, methodical, is liable at any moment
to the same good fortune as befel Saul of old, when he went out to seek
his father&rsquo;s asses, and found a kingdom.</p>
<p>There are those, lastly, who have neither time nor taste for the
technicalities, and nice distinctions, of formal Natural History; who
enjoy Nature, but as artists or as sportsmen, and not as men of science.&nbsp;
Let them follow their bent freely: but let them not suppose that in
following it they can do nothing towards enlarging our knowledge of
Nature, especially when on foreign stations.&nbsp; So far from it, drawings
ought always to be valuable, whether of plants, animals, or scenery,
provided only they are accurate; and the more spirited and full of genius
they are, the more accurate they are certain to be; for Nature being
alive, a lifeless copy of her is necessarily an untrue copy.&nbsp; Most
thankful to any officer for a mere sight of sketches will be the closet
botanist, who, to his own sorrow, knows three-fourths of his plants
only from dried specimens; or the closet zoologist, who knows his animals
from skins and bones.&nbsp; And if anyone answers&mdash;But I cannot
draw.&nbsp; I rejoin, You can at least photograph.&nbsp; If a young
officer, going out to foreign parts, and knowing nothing at all about
physical science, did me the honour to ask me what he could do for science,
I should tell him&mdash;Learn to photograph; take photographs of every
strange bit of rock-formation which strikes your fancy, and of every
widely extended view which may give a notion of the general lie of the
country.&nbsp; Append, if you can, a note or two, saying whether a plain
is rich or barren; whether the rock is sandstone, limestone, granitic,
metamorphic, or volcanic lava; and if there be more rocks than one,
which of them lies on the other; and send them to be exhibited at a
meeting of the Geological Society.&nbsp; I doubt not that the learned
gentlemen there will find in your photographs a valuable hint or two,
for which they will be much obliged.&nbsp; I learnt, for instance, what
seemed to me most valuable geological lessons, from mere glances at
drawings&mdash;I believe from photographs&mdash;of the Abyssinian ranges
about Magdala.</p>
<p>Or again, let a man, if he knows nothing of botany, not trouble himself
with collecting and drying specimens; let him simply photograph every
strange and new tree or plant he sees, to give a general notion of its
species, its look; let him append, where he can, a photograph of its
leafage, flower, fruit; and send them to Dr. Hooker, or any distinguished
botanist: and he will find that, though he may know nothing of botany,
he will have pretty certainly increased the knowledge of those who do
know.</p>
<p>The sportsman, again&mdash;I mean the sportsman of that type which
seems peculiar to these islands, who loves toil and danger for their
own sakes; he surely is a naturalist, ipso facto, though he knows it
not.&nbsp; He has those very habits of keen observation on which all
sound knowledge of nature is based; and he, if he will&mdash;as he may
do without interfering with his sport&mdash;can study the habits of
the animals among whom he spends wholesome and exciting days.&nbsp;
You have only to look over such good old books as Williams&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wild
Sports of the East,&rsquo; Campbell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Old Forest Ranger,&rsquo;
Lloyd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Scandinavian Adventures,&rsquo; and last, but not
least, Waterton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wanderings,&rsquo; to see what valuable
additions to true zoology&mdash;the knowledge of live creatures, not
merely dead ones&mdash;British sportsmen have made, and still can make.&nbsp;
And as for the employment of time, which often hangs so heavily on a
soldier&rsquo;s hands, really I am ready to say, if you are neither
men of science, nor draughtsmen, nor sportsmen, why go and collect beetles.&nbsp;
It is not very dignified, I know, nor exciting: but it will be something
to do.&nbsp; It cannot harm you, if you take, as beetle-hunters do,
an india-rubber sheet to lie on; and it will certainly benefit science.&nbsp;
Moreover, there will be a noble humility in the act.&nbsp; You will
confess to the public that you consider yourself only fit to catch beetles;
by which very confession you will prove yourself fit for much finer
things than catching beetles: and meanwhile, as I said before, you will
be at least out of harm&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; At a foreign barrack once,
the happiest officer I met, because the most regularly employed, was
one who spent his time in collecting butterflies.&nbsp; He knew nothing
about them scientifically&mdash;not even their names.&nbsp; He took
them simply for their wonderful beauty and variety; and in the hope,
too&mdash;in which he was really scientific&mdash;that if he carefully
kept every form which he saw, his collection might be of use some day
to entomologists at home.&nbsp; A most pleasant gentleman he was; and,
I doubt not, none the worse soldier for his butterfly catching.&nbsp;
Commendable, also, in my eyes, was another officer&mdash;whom I have
not the pleasure of knowing&mdash;who, on a remote foreign station,
used wisely to escape from the temptations of the world into an entirely
original and most pleasant hermitage.&nbsp; For finding&mdash;so the
story went&mdash;that many of the finest insects kept to the tree-tops,
and never came to ground at all, he used to settle himself among the
boughs of some tree in the tropic forests, with a long-handled net and
plenty of cigars, and pass his hours in that airy flower garden, making
dashes every now and then at some splendid monster as it fluttered round
his head.&nbsp; His example need not be followed by everyone; but it
must be allowed that&mdash;at least as long as he was in his tree&mdash;he
was neither dawdling, grumbling, spending money, nor otherwise harming
himself, and perhaps his fellow creatures, from sheer want of employment.</p>
<p>One word more, and I have done.&nbsp; If I was allowed to give one
special piece of advice to a young officer, whether of the army or navy,
I would say&mdash;Respect scientific men; associate with them; learn
from them; find them to be, as you will usually, the most pleasant and
instructive of companions: but always respect them.&nbsp; Allow them
chivalrously, you who have an acknowledged rank, their yet unacknowledged
rank; and treat them as all the world will treat them, in a higher and
truer state of civilisation.&nbsp; They do not yet wear the Queen&rsquo;s
uniform; they are not yet accepted servants of the State; as they will
be in some more perfectly organised and civilised land: but they are
soldiers nevertheless, and good soldiers and chivalrous, fighting their
nation&rsquo;s battle, often on even less pay than you,&mdash;and with
still less chance of promotion and of fame, against most real and fatal
enemies&mdash;against ignorance of the laws of this planet, and all
the miseries which that ignorance begets.&nbsp; Honour them for their
work; sympathise in it; give them a helping hand in it whenever you
have an opportunity&mdash;and what opportunities you have, I have been
trying to sketch for you to-night; and more, work at it yourselves whenever
and wherever you can.&nbsp; Show them that the spirit which animates
them&mdash;the hatred of ignorance and disorder, and of their bestial
consequences&mdash;animates you likewise; show them that the habit of
mind which they value in themselves&mdash;the habit of accurate observation
and careful judgment&mdash;is your habit likewise; show them that you
value science, not merely because it gives better weapons of destruction
and of defence, but because it helps you to become clear-headed, large-minded,
able to take a just and accurate view of any subject which comes before
you, and to cast away every old prejudice and every hasty judgment in
the face of truth and of duty: and it will be better for you and for
them.</p>
<p>But why?&nbsp; What need for the soldier and the man of science to
fraternise just now?&nbsp; This need:&mdash;The two classes which will
have an increasing, it may be a preponderating, influence on the fate
of the human race for some time, will be the pupils of Aristotle and
those of Alexander&mdash;the men of science and the soldiers.&nbsp;
In spite of all appearances, and all declamations to the contrary, that
is my firm conviction.&nbsp; They, and they alone, will be left to rule;
because they alone, each in his own sphere, have learnt to obey.&nbsp;
It is therefore most needful for the welfare of society that they should
pull with, and not against each other; that they should understand each
other, respect each other, take counsel with each other, supplement
each other&rsquo;s defects, bring out each other&rsquo;s higher tendencies,
counteract each other&rsquo;s lower ones.&nbsp; The scientific man has
something to learn of you, gentlemen, which I doubt not that he will
learn in good time.&nbsp; You, again, have&mdash;as I have been hinting
to you to-night&mdash;something to learn of him, which you, I doubt
not, will learn in good time likewise.&nbsp; Repeat, each of you according
to his powers, the old friendship between Aristotle and Alexander; and
so, from the sympathy and co-operation of you two, a class of thinkers
and actors may yet arise which can save this nation, and the other civilised
nations of the world, from that of which I had rather not speak; and
wish that I did not think, too often and too earnestly.</p>
<p>I may be a dreamer: and I may consider, in my turn, as wilder dreamers
than myself, certain persons who fancy that their only business in life
is to make money, the scientific man&rsquo;s only business is to show
them how to make money, and the soldier&rsquo;s only business to guard
their money for them.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the finest type of civilised
man which we are likely to see for some generations to come, will be
produced by a combination of the truly military with the truly scientific
man.&nbsp; I say&mdash;I may be a dreamer: but you at least, as well
as my scientific friends, will bear with me; for my dream is to your
honour.</p>
<h2>ON BIO-GEOLOGY.<br />
AN ADDRESS GIVEN TO THE SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY OF WINCHESTER.</h2>
<p>I am not sure that the subject of my address is rightly chosen.&nbsp;
I am not sure that I ought not to have postponed a question of mere
natural history, to speak to you, as scientific men, on the questions
of life and death, which have been forced upon us by the awful warning
of an illustrious personage&rsquo;s illness; of preventible disease,
its frightful prevalency; of the 200,000 persons who are said to have
died of fever alone since the Prince Consort&rsquo;s death, ten years
ago; of the remedies; of drainage; of sewage disinfection and utilisation;
and of the assistance which you, as a body of scientific men, can give
to any effort towards saving the lives and health of our fellow-citizens
from those unseen poisons which lurk like wild beasts couched in the
jungle, ready to spring at any moment on the unsuspecting, the innocent,
the helpless.&nbsp; Of all this I longed to speak: but I thought it
best only to hint at it, and leave the question to your common sense
and your humanity; taking for granted that your minds, like the minds
of all right-minded Englishmen, have been of late painfully awakened
to its importance.&nbsp; It seemed to me almost an impertinence to say
more in a city of whose local circumstances I know little or nothing.&nbsp;
As an old sanitary reformer, practical, as well as theoretical, I am
but too well aware of the difficulties which beset any complete scheme
of drainage, especially in an ancient city like this; where men are
paying the penalty of their predecessors&rsquo; ignorance; and dwelling,
whether they choose or not, over fifteen centuries of accumulated dirt.</p>
<p>And, therefore, taking for granted that there is energy and intellect
enough in Winchester to conquer these difficulties in due time, I go
on to ask you to consider, for a time, a subject which is growing more
and more important and interesting, a subject the study of which will
do much towards raising the field naturalist from a mere collector of
specimens&mdash;as he was twenty years ago&mdash;to a philosopher elucidating
some of the grandest problems.&nbsp; I mean the infant science of Bio-geology&mdash;the
science which treats of the distribution of plants and animals over
the globe, and the causes of that distribution.</p>
<p>I doubt not that there are many here who know far more about the
subject than I; who are far better read than I am in the works of Forbes,
Darwin, Wallace, Hooker, Moritz Wagner, and the other illustrious men
who have written on it.&nbsp; But I may, perhaps, give a few hints which
will be of use to the younger members of this Society, and will point
out to them how to get a new relish for the pursuit of field science.</p>
<p>Bio-geology, then, begins with asking every plant or animal you meet,
large or small, not merely&mdash;What is your name?&nbsp; That is the
collector and classifier&rsquo;s duty; and a most necessary duty it
is, and one to be performed with the most conscientious patience and
accuracy, so that a sound foundation may be built for future speculations.&nbsp;
But young naturalists should act not merely as Nature&rsquo;s registrars
and census-takers, but as her policemen and gamekeepers; and ask everything
they meet&mdash;How did you get here?&nbsp; By what road did you come?&nbsp;
What was your last place of abode?&nbsp; And now you are here, how do
you get your living?&nbsp; Are you and your children thriving, like
decent people who can take care of themselves, or growing pauperised
and degraded, and dying out?&nbsp; Not that we have a fear of your becoming
a dangerous class.&nbsp; Madam Nature allows no dangerous classes, in
the modern sense.&nbsp; She has, doubtless for some wise reason, no
mercy for the weak.&nbsp; She rewards each organism according to its
works; and if anything grows too weak or stupid to take care of itself,
she gives it its due deserts by letting it die and disappear.&nbsp;
So, you plant or you animal, are you among the strong, the successful,
the multiplying, the colonising?&nbsp; Or are you among the weak, the
failing, the dwindling, the doomed?</p>
<p>These questions may seem somewhat rude: but you may comfort yourself
by the thought that plants and animals, though they deserve all kindness,
all admiration, deserve no courtesy&mdash;at least in this respect.&nbsp;
For they are, one and all, wherever you find them, vagrants and landloupers,
intruders and conquerors, who have got where they happen to be simply
by the law of the strongest&mdash;generally not without a little robbery
and murder.&nbsp; They have no right save that of possession; the same
by which the puffin turns out the old rabbits, eats the young ones,
and then lays her eggs in the rabbit burrow&mdash;simply because she
can.</p>
<p>Now, you will see at once that such a course of questioning will
call out a great many curious and interesting answers, if you can only
get the things to tell you their story; as you always may, if you will
cross-examine them long enough; and will lead you into many subjects
beside mere botany or entomology.&nbsp; So various, indeed, are the
subjects which you will thus start, that I can only hint at them now
in the most cursory fashion.</p>
<p>At the outset you will soon find yourself involved in chemical and
meteorological questions: as, for instance, when you ask&mdash;How is
it that I find one flora on the sea-shore, another on the sandstone,
another on the chalk, and another on the peat-making gravelly strata?&nbsp;
The usual answer would be, I presume&mdash;if we could work it out by
twenty years&rsquo; experiment, such as Mr. Lawes, of Rothampsted, has
been making on the growth of grasses and leguminous plants in different
soils and under different manures&mdash;the usual answer, I say, would
be&mdash;Because we plants want such and such mineral constituents in
our woody fibre; again, because we want a certain amount of moisture
at a certain period of the year: or, perhaps, simply because the mechanical
arrangement of the particles of a certain soil happens to suit the shape
of our roots and of their stomata.&nbsp; Sometimes you will get an answer
quickly enough; sometimes not.&nbsp; If you ask, for instance, <i>Asplenium
viride</i> how it contrives to grow plentifully in the Craven of Yorkshire
down to 600 or 800 feet above the sea, while in Snowdon it dislikes
growing lower than 2000 feet, and is not plentiful even there?&mdash;it
will reply&mdash;Because in the Craven I can get as much carbonic acid
as I want from the decomposing limestone: while on the Snowdon Silurian
I get very little; and I have to make it up by clinging to the mountain
tops, for the sake of the greater rainfall.&nbsp; But if you ask <i>Polopodium
calcareum</i>&mdash;How is it you choose only to grow on limestone,
while <i>Polypodium Dryopteris</i>, of which, I suspect, you are only
a variety, is ready to grow anywhere?&mdash;<i>Polypodium calcareum</i>
will refuse, as yet, to answer a word.</p>
<p>Again&mdash;I can only give you the merest string of hints&mdash;you
will find in your questionings that many plants and animals have no
reason at all to show why they should be in one place and not in another,
save the very sound reason for the latter which was suggested to me
once by a great naturalist.&nbsp; I was asking&mdash;Why don&rsquo;t
I find such and such a species in my parish, while it is plentiful a
few miles off in exactly the same soil?&mdash;and he answered&mdash;For
the same reason that you are not in America.&nbsp; Because you have
not got there.&nbsp; Which answer threw to me a flood of light on this
whole science.&nbsp; Things are often where they are, simply because
they happen to have got there, and not elsewhere.&nbsp; But they must
have got there by some means: and those means I want young naturalists
to discover; at least to guess at.</p>
<p>A species, for instance&mdash;and I suspect it is a common case with
insects&mdash;may abound in a single spot, simply because, long years
ago, a single brood of eggs happened to hatch at a time when eggs of
other species, who would have competed against them for food, did not
hatch; and they may remain confined to that spot, though there is plenty
of good food for them outside it, simply because they do not increase
fast enough to require to spread out in search of more food.&nbsp; Thus
I should explain a case which I heard of lately of <i>Anthocera trifolii</i>,
abundant for years in one corner of a certain field, and only there;
while there was just as much trefoil all round for its larv&aelig; as
there was in the selected spot.&nbsp; I can, I say, only give hints:
but they will suffice, I hope, to show the path of thought into which
I want young naturalists to turn their minds.</p>
<p>Or, again, you will have to inquire whether the species has not been
prevented from spreading by some natural barrier.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace,
whom you all of course know, has shown in his &lsquo;Malay Archipelago&rsquo;
that a strait of deep sea can act as such a barrier between species.&nbsp;
Moritz Wagner has shown that, in the case of insects, a moderately broad
river may divide two closely allied species of beetles, or a very narrow
snow-range two closely allied species of moths.</p>
<p>Again, another cause, and a most common one is: that the plants cannot
spread because they find the ground beyond them already occupied by
other plants, who will not tolerate a fresh mouth, having only just
enough to feed themselves.&nbsp; Take the case of <i>Saxifraga hypnoides</i>
and <i>S. umbrosa</i>, &ldquo;London pride.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are two
especially strong species.&nbsp; They show that, <i>S. hypnoides</i>
especially, by their power of sporting, of diverging into varieties;
they show it equally by their power of thriving anywhere, if they can
only get there.&nbsp; They will both grow in my sandy garden, under
a rainfall of only 23 inches, more luxuriantly than in their native
mountains under a rainfall of 50 or 60 inches.&nbsp; Then how is it
that <i>S. hypnoides</i> cannot get down off the mountains; and that
<i>S. umbrosa</i>, though in Kerry it has got off the mountains and
down to the sea level, exterminating, I suspect, many species in its
progress, yet cannot get across county Cork?&nbsp; The only answer is,
I believe: that both species are continually trying to go ahead; but
that the other plants already in front of them are too strong for them,
and massacre their infants as soon as born.</p>
<p>And this brings us to another curious question: the sudden and abundant
appearance of plants, like the foxglove and <i>Epilobium angustifolium</i>,
in spots where they have never been seen before.&nbsp; Are their seeds,
as some think, dormant in the ground; or are the seeds which have germinated
fresh ones wafted thither by wind or otherwise, and only able to germinate
in that one spot, because there the soil is clear?&nbsp; General Monro,
now famous for his unequalled memoir on the bamboos, holds to the latter
theory.&nbsp; He pointed out to me that the <i>Epilobium</i> seeds,
being feathered, could travel with the wind; that the plant always made
its appearance first on new banks, landslips, clearings, where it had
nothing to compete against; and that the foxglove did the same.&nbsp;
True, and most painfully true, in the case of thistles and groundsels:
but foxglove seeds, though minute, would hardly be carried by the wind
any more than those of the white clover, which comes up so abundantly
in drained fens.&nbsp; Adhuc sub judice lis est, and I wish some young
naturalists would work carefully at the solution; by experiment, which
is the most sure way to find out anything.</p>
<p>But in researches in this direction they will find puzzles enough.&nbsp;
I will give them one which I shall be most thankful to hear they have
solved within the next seven years&mdash;How is it that we find certain
plants, namely, the thrift and the scurvy grass, abundant on the sea-shore
and common on certain mountain-tops, but nowhere between the two?&nbsp;
Answer me that.&nbsp; For I have looked at the fact for years&mdash;before,
behind, sideways, upside down, and inside out&mdash;and I cannot understand
it.</p>
<p>But all these questions, and specially, I suspect, that last one,
ought to lead the young student up to the great and complex question&mdash;How
were these islands re-peopled with plants and animals, after the long
and wholesale catastrophe of the glacial epoch?</p>
<p>I presume you all know, and will agree, that the whole of these islands,
north of the Thames, save certain ice-clad mountain-tops, were buried
for long ages under an icy sea.&nbsp; From whence did vegetable and
animal life crawl back to the land, as it rose again; and cover its
mantle of glacial drift with fresh life and verdure?</p>
<p>Now let me give you a few prolegomena on this matter.&nbsp; You must
study the plants of course, species by species.&nbsp; Take Watson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Cybele Britannica,&rsquo; and Moore&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cybele Hibernica;&rsquo;
and let&mdash;as Mr. Matthew Arnold would say&mdash;&ldquo;your thought
play freely about them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Look carefully, too, in the case
of each species, at the note on its distribution, which you will find
appended in Bentham&rsquo;s &lsquo;Handbook,&rsquo; and in Hooker&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Student&rsquo;s Flora.&rsquo;&nbsp; Get all the help you can,
if you wish to work the subject out, from foreign botanists, both European
and American; and I think that, on the whole, you will come to some
such theory as this for a general starting platform.&nbsp; We do not
owe our flora&mdash;I must keep to the flora just now&mdash;to so many
different regions, or types, as Mr. Watson conceives, but to three,
namely: an European or Germanic flora, from the south-east; an Atlantic
flora, from the south-west; a Northern flora from the north.&nbsp; These
three invaded us after the glacial epoch; and our general flora is their
result.</p>
<p>But this will cause you much trouble.&nbsp; Before you go a step
further you will have to eliminate from all your calculations most of
the plants which Watson calls glareal, <i>i.e</i>. found in cultivated
ground about habitations.&nbsp; And what their limit may be I think
we never shall know.&nbsp; But of this we may be sure; that just as
invading armies always bring with them, in forage or otherwise, some
plants from their own country&mdash;just as the Cossacks, in 1815, brought
more than one Russian plant through Germany into France&mdash;just as
you have already a crop of North German plants upon the battle-fields
of France&mdash;thus do conquering races bring new plants.&nbsp; The
Romans, during their 300 or 400 years of occupation and civilisation,
must have brought more species, I believe, than I dare mention.&nbsp;
I suspect them of having brought, not merely the common hedge elm of
the south, not merely the three species of nettle, but all our red poppies,
and a great number of the weeds which are common in our cornfields;
and when we add to them the plants which may have been brought by returning
crusaders and pilgrims; by monks from every part of Europe, by Flemings
or other dealers in foreign wool; we have to cut a huge cantle out of
our indigenous flora: only, having no records, we hardly know where
and what to cut out; and can only, we elder ones, recommend the subject
to the notice of the younger botanists, that they may work it out after
our work is done.</p>
<p>Of course these plants introduced by man, if they are cut out, must
be cut out of only one of the floras, namely, the European; for they,
probably, came from the south-east, by whatever means they came.</p>
<p>That European flora invaded us, I presume, immediately after the
glacial epoch, at a time when France and England were united, and the
German Ocean a mere network of rivers, which emptied into the deep sea
between Scotland and Scandinavia.&nbsp; And here I must add, that endless
questions of interest will arise to those who will study, not merely
the invasion of that truly European flora, but the invasion of reptiles,
insects, and birds, especially birds of passage, which must have followed
it as soon as the land was sufficiently covered with vegetation to support
life.&nbsp; Whole volumes remain to be written on this subject.&nbsp;
I trust that some of your younger members may live to write one of them.&nbsp;
The way to begin will be: to compare the flora and fauna of this part
of England very carefully with that of the southern and eastern counties;
and then to compare them again with the fauna and flora of France, Belgium,
and Holland.</p>
<p>As for the Atlantic flora, you will have to decide for yourselves
whether you accept or not the theory of a sunken Atlantic continent.&nbsp;
I confess that all objections to that theory, however astounding it
may seem, are outweighed in my mind by a host of facts which I can explain
by no other theory.&nbsp; But you must judge for yourselves; and to
do so you must study carefully the distribution of heaths, both in Europe
and at the Cape; and their non-appearance beyond the Ural Mountains,
and in America, save in Labrador, where the common ling, an older and
less specialised form, exists.&nbsp; You must consider, too, the plants
common to the Azores, Portugal, the West of England, Ireland, and the
Western Hebrides.&nbsp; In so doing young naturalists will at least
find proofs of a change in the distribution of land and water, which
will utterly astound them when they face it for the first time.</p>
<p>As for the Northern flora, the question whence it came is puzzling
enough.&nbsp; It seems difficult to conceive how any plants could have
survived when Scotland was an archipelago in the same ice-covered condition
as Greenland is now; and we have no proof that there existed after the
glacial epoch any northern continent from which the plants and animals
could have come back to us.&nbsp; The species of plants and animals
common to Britain, Scandinavia, and North America, must have spread
in pre-glacial times, when a continent joining them did exist.</p>
<p>But some light has been thrown on this question by an article, as
charming as it is able, on &ldquo;The Physics of the Arctic Ice,&rdquo;
by Dr. Brown, of Campster.&nbsp; You will find it in the &lsquo;Quarterly
Journal of the Geological Society&rsquo; for February 1870.&nbsp; He
shows there that even in Greenland peaks and crags are left free enough
from ice to support a vegetation of between 300 or 400 species of flowering
plants; and, therefore, he well says, we must be careful to avoid concluding
that the plant and animal life on the dreary shores or mountain-tops
of the old glacial Scotland was poor.&nbsp; The same would hold good
of our mountains; and, if so, we may look with respect, even with awe,
on the Alpine plants of Wales, Scotland, and the Lake mountains, as
organisms stunted, it may be, and even degraded, by their long battle
with the elements; but venerable from their age, historic from their
endurance.&nbsp; Relics of an older temperate world, they have lived
through thousands of centuries of frost and fog, to sun themselves in
a temperate climate once more.&nbsp; I can never pick one of them without
a tinge of shame; and to exterminate one of them is to destroy for the
mere pleasure of collecting the last of a family which God has taken
the trouble to preserve for thousands of centuries.</p>
<p>I trust that these hints&mdash;for I can call them nothing more&mdash;will
at least awaken any young naturalist who has hitherto only collected
natural objects, to study the really important and interesting question&mdash;How
did these things get here?</p>
<p>Now hence arise questions which may puzzle the mind of a Hampshire
naturalist.&nbsp; You have in this neighbourhood, as you well know,
two, or rather three, soils, each carrying its peculiar vegetation.&nbsp;
First, you have the clay lying on the chalk, and carrying vast woodlands,
seemingly primeval.&nbsp; Next, you have the chalk, with its peculiar,
delicate, and often fragrant crop of lime-loving plants; and next you
have the poor sands and clays of the New Forest basin, saturated with
iron, and therefore carrying a moorland or peat-loving vegetation, in
many respects quite different from the others.&nbsp; And this moorland
soil, and this vegetation, with a few singular exceptions, repeats itself,
as I daresay you know, in the north of the county, in the Bagshot basin,
as it is called&mdash;the moors of Aldershot, Hartford Bridge, and Windsor
Forest.</p>
<p>Now what a variety of interesting questions are opened up by these
simple facts.&nbsp; How did these three floras get each to its present
place?&nbsp; Where did each come from?&nbsp; How did it get past or
through the other, till each set of plants, after long internecine competition,
settled itself down in the sheet of land most congenial to it?&nbsp;
And when did each come hither?&nbsp; Which is the oldest?&nbsp; Will
any one tell me whether the heathy flora of the moors, or the thymy
flora of the chalk downs, were the earlier inhabitants of these isles?&nbsp;
To these questions I cannot get any answer; and they cannot be answered
without first&mdash;a very careful study of the range of each species
of plant on the continent of Europe; and next, without careful study
of those stupendous changes in the shape of this island which have taken
place at a very late geological epoch.&nbsp; The composition of the
flora of our moorlands is as yet to me an utter puzzle.&nbsp; We have
Lycopodiums&mdash;three species&mdash;enormously ancient forms which
have survived the age of ice: but did they crawl downward hither from
the northern mountains, or upward hither from the Pyrenees?&nbsp; We
have the beautiful bog asphodel again&mdash;an enormously ancient form;
for it is, strange to say, common to North America and to Northern Europe,
but does not enter Asia&mdash;almost an unique instance.&nbsp; It must,
surely, have come from the north; and points&mdash;as do many species
of plants and animals&mdash;to the time when North Europe and North
America were joined.&nbsp; We have, sparingly, in North Hampshire, though,
strangely, not on the Bagshot moors, the Common or Northern Butterwort
(<i>Pinguicula vulgaris</i>); and also, in the south, the New Forest
part of the county, the delicate little <i>Pinguicula lusitanica</i>,
the only species now found in Devon and Cornwall, marking the New Forest
as the extreme eastern limit of the Atlantic flora.&nbsp; We have again
the heaths, which, as I have just said, are found neither in America
nor in Asia, and must, I believe, have come from some south-western
land long since submerged beneath the sea.&nbsp; But more, we have in
the New Forest two plants which are members of the South Europe, or
properly, the Atlantic flora; which must have come from the south and
south-east; and which are found in no other spots in these islands.&nbsp;
I mean the lovely <i>Gladiolus</i>, which grows abundantly under the
ferns near Lyndhurst, certainly wild but it does not approach England
elsewhere nearer than the Loire and the Rhine; and next, that delicate
orchid, the <i>Spiranthes &aelig;stivalis</i>, which is known only in
a bog near Lyndhurst and in the Channel Islands, while on the Continent
it extends from southern Europe all through France.&nbsp; Now, what
do these two plants mark?&nbsp; They give us a point in botany, though
not in time, to determine when the south of England was parted from
the opposite shores of France; and whenever that was, it was just after
the Gladiolus and Spiranthes got hither.&nbsp; Two little colonies of
these lovely flowers arrived just before their retreat was cut off.&nbsp;
They found the country already occupied with other plants; and, not
being reinforced by fresh colonists from the south, have not been able
to spread farther north than Lyndhurst.&nbsp; Thus, in the New Forest,
and, I may say, in the Bagshot moors, you find plants which you do not
expect, and do not find plants which you do expect; and you are, or
ought to be, puzzled, and I hope also interested, and stirred up to
find out more.</p>
<p>I spoke just now of the time when England was joined to France, as
bearing on Hampshire botany.&nbsp; It bears no less on Hampshire zoology.&nbsp;
In insects, for instance, the presence of the purple emperor and the
white admiral in our Hampshire woods, as well as the abundance of the
great stag-beetle, point to a time when the two countries were joined,
at least, as far west as Hampshire; while the absence of these insects
farther to the westward shows that the countries, if ever joined, were
already parted; and that those insects have not yet had time to spread
westward.&nbsp; The presence of these two butterflies, and partly of
the stag-beetle, along the south-east coast of England as far as the
primeval forests of South Lincolnshire, points&mdash;as do a hundred
other facts&mdash;to a time when the Straits of Dover either did not
exist, or were the bed of a river running from the west; and when, as
I told you just now, all the rivers which now run into the German Ocean,
from the Humber on the west to the Elbe on the east, discharged themselves
into the sea between Scotland and Norway, after wandering through a
vast lowland, covered with countless herds of mammoth, rhinoceros, gigantic
ox, and other mammals now extinct; while the birds, as far as we know;
the insects; the fresh-water fish; and even, as my friend Mr. Brady
has proved, the <i>Entomostraca</i> of the rivers, were the same in
what is now Holland as in what is now our Eastern counties.&nbsp; I
could dwell long on this matter.&nbsp; I could talk long about how certain
species of <i>Lepidoptera</i>&mdash;moths and butterflies&mdash;like
<i>Papilio Machaon</i> and <i>P. Podalirius</i>, swarm through France,
reach up to the British Channel, and have not crossed it; with the exception
of one colony of <i>Machaon</i> in the Cambridgeshire fens.&nbsp; I
could talk long about a similar phenomenon in the case of our migratory
and singing birds: how many exquisite species&mdash;notably those two
glorious songsters, the Orphean Warbler and Hippolais, which delight
our ears everywhere on the other side of the Channel&mdash;follow our
nightingales, blackcaps, and warblers northward every spring almost
to the Straits of Dover: but dare not cross, simply because they have
been, as it were, created since the gulf was opened, and have never
learnt from their parents how to fly over it.</p>
<p>In the case of fishes, again, I might say much on the curious fact
that the Cyprinid&aelig;, or white fish&mdash;carp, &amp;c.&mdash;and
their natural enemy, the pike, are indigenous, I believe, only to the
rivers, English or continental, on the eastern side of the Straits of
Dover; while the rivers on the western side were originally tenanted,
like our Hampshire streams, as now, almost entirely by trout, their
only Cyprinoid being the minnow&mdash;if it, too, be not an interloper;
and I might ask you to consider the bearing of this curious fact on
the former junction of England and France.</p>
<p>But I have only time to point out to you a few curious facts with
regard to reptiles, which should be specially interesting to a Hampshire
bio-geologist.&nbsp; You know, of course, that in Ireland there are
no reptiles, save the little common lizard, <i>Lacerta agilis</i>, and
a few frogs on the mountain-tops&mdash;how they got there I cannot conceive.&nbsp;
And you will, of course, guess, and rightly, that the reason of the
absence of reptiles is: that Ireland was parted off from England before
the creatures, which certainly spread from southern and warmer climates,
had time to get there.&nbsp; You know, of course, that we have a few
reptiles in England.&nbsp; But you may not be aware that, as soon as
you cross the Channel, you find many more species of reptiles than here,
as well as those which you find here.&nbsp; The magnificent green lizard
which rattles about like a rabbit in a French forest, is never found
here; simply because it had not worked northward till after the Channel
was formed.&nbsp; But there are three reptiles peculiar to this part
of England which should be most interesting to a Hampshire zoologist.&nbsp;
The one is the sand lizard (<i>L. stirpium</i>), found on Bourne-heath,
and, I suspect, in the South Hampshire moors likewise&mdash;a North
European and French species.&nbsp; Another, the <i>Coronella l&aelig;vis</i>,
a harmless French and Austrian snake, which has been found about me,
in North Hants and South Berks, now about fifteen or twenty times.&nbsp;
I have had three specimens from my own parish.&nbsp; I believe it not
to be uncommon; and most probably to be found, by those who will look,
both in the New Forest and Woolmer.&nbsp; The third is the Natterjack,
or running toad (<i>Bufo Rubeta</i>), a most beautifully spotted animal,
with a yellow stripe down his back, which is common with me at Eversley,
and common also in many moorlands of Hants and Surrey; and, according
to Fleming, on heaths near London, and as far north-east as Lincolnshire;
in which case it will belong to the Germanic fauna.&nbsp; Now, here
again we have cases of animals which have just been able to get hither
before the severance of England and France; and which, not being reinforced
from the rear, have been forced to stop, in small and probably decreasing
colonies, on the spots nearest the coast which were fit for them.</p>
<p>I trust that I have not kept you too long over these details.&nbsp;
What I wish to impress upon you is that Hampshire is a county specially
fitted for the study of important bio-geological questions.</p>
<p>To work them out, you must trace the geology of Hampshire, and, indeed,
of East Dorset.&nbsp; You must try to form a conception of how the land
was shaped in miocene times, before that tremendous upheaval which reared
the chalk cliffs at Freshwater upright, lifting the tertiary beds upon
their northern slopes.&nbsp; You must ask&mdash;Was there not land to
the south of the Isle of Wight in those ages, and for ages after; and
what was its extent and shape?&nbsp; You must ask&mdash;When was the
gap between the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Purbeck sawn through,
leaving the Needles as remnants on one side, and Old Harry on the opposite?&nbsp;
And was it sawn asunder merely by the age-long gnawing of the waves?&nbsp;
You must ask&mdash;Where did the great river which ran from the west,
where Poole Harbour is now, and probably through what is now the Solent,
depositing brackish water-beds right and left&mdash;where, I say, did
it run into the sea?&nbsp; Where the Straits of Dover are now?&nbsp;
Or, if not there, where?&nbsp; What, too, is become of the land to the
Westward, composed of ancient metamorphic rocks, out of which it ran,
and deposited on what are now the Haggerstone Moors of Poole, vast beds
of grit?&nbsp; What was the climate on its banks when it washed down
the delicate leaves of broad-leaved trees, akin to our modern English
ones, which are found in the fine mud-sand strata of Bournemouth?&nbsp;
When, finally, did it dwindle down to the brook which now runs through
Wareham town?&nbsp; Was its bed sea, or dry land, or under an ice sheet,
during the long ages of the glacial epoch?&nbsp; And if you say&mdash;Who
is sufficient for these things?&mdash;Who can answer these questions?&nbsp;
I answer&mdash;Who but you, or your pupils after you, if you will but
try?</p>
<p>And if any shall reply&mdash;And what use if I do try?&nbsp; What
use, if I do try?&nbsp; What use if I succeed in answering every question
which you have propounded to-night?&nbsp; Shall I be the happier for
it?&nbsp; Shall I be the wiser?</p>
<p>My friends, whether you will be the happier for it, or for any knowledge
of physical science, or for any other knowledge whatsoever, I cannot
tell: that lies in the decision of a Higher Power than I; and, indeed,
to speak honestly, I do not think that bio-geology or any other branch
of physical science is likely, at first at least, to make you happy.&nbsp;
Neither is the study of your fellow-men.&nbsp; Neither is religion itself.&nbsp;
We were not sent into the world to be happy, but to be right; at least,
poor creatures that we are, as right as we can be; and we must be content
with being right, and not happy.&nbsp; For I fear, or rather I hope,
that most of us are not capable of carrying out Talleyrand&rsquo;s recipe
for perfect happiness on earth&mdash;namely, a hard heart and a good
digestion.&nbsp; Therefore, as our hearts are, happily, not always hard,
and our digestions, unhappily, not always good, we will be content to
be made wise by physical science, even though we be not made happy.</p>
<p>And we shall be made truly wise if we be made content; content, too,
not only with what we can understand, but, content with what we do not
understand&mdash;the habit of mind which theologians call&mdash;and
rightly&mdash;faith in God; the true and solid faith, which comes often
out of sadness, and out of doubt, such as bio-geology may well stir
in us at first sight.&nbsp; For our first feeling will be&mdash;I know
mine was when I began to look into these matters&mdash;one somewhat
of dread and of horror.</p>
<p>Here were all these creatures, animal and vegetable, competing against
each other.&nbsp; And their competition was so earnest and complete,
that it did not mean&mdash;as it does among honest shopkeepers in a
civilised country&mdash;I will make a little more money than you; but&mdash;I
will crush you, enslave you, exterminate you, eat you up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Woe
to the weak,&rdquo; seems to be Nature&rsquo;s watchword.&nbsp; The
Psalmist says, &ldquo;The righteous shall inherit the land.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If you go to a tropical forest, or, indeed, if you observe carefully
a square acre of any English land, cultivated or uncultivated, you will
find that Nature&rsquo;s text at first sight looks a very different
one.&nbsp; She seems to say&mdash;Not the righteous, but the strong,
shall inherit the land.&nbsp; Plant, insect, bird, what not&mdash;Find
a weaker plant, insect, bird, than yourself, and kill it, and take possession
of its little vineyard, and no Naboth&rsquo;s curse shall follow you:
but you shall inherit, and thrive therein, you, and your children after
you, if they will be only as strong and as cruel as you are.&nbsp; That
is Nature&rsquo;s law: and is it not at first sight a fearful law?&nbsp;
Internecine competition, ruthless selfishness, so internecine and so
ruthless that, as I have wandered in tropic forests, where this temper
is shown more quickly and fiercely, though not in the least more evilly,
than in our slow and cold temperate one, I have said&mdash;Really these
trees and plants are as wicked as so many human beings.</p>
<p>Throughout the great republic of the organic world, the motto of
the majority is, and always has been as far back as we can see, what
it is, and always has been, with the majority of human beings, &ldquo;Every
one for himself, and the devil take the hindmost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Over-reaching
tyranny; the temper which fawns, and clings, and plays the parasite
as long as it is down, and when it has risen, fattens on its patron&rsquo;s
blood and life&mdash;these, and the other works of the flesh, are the
works of average plants and animals, as far as they can practise them.&nbsp;
At least, so says at first sight the science of bio-geology; till the
naturalist, if he be also human and humane, is glad to escape from the
confusion and darkness of the universal battle-field of selfishness
into the order and light of Christmas-tide.</p>
<p>For then there comes to him the thought&mdash;And are these all the
facts?&nbsp; And is this all which the facts mean?&nbsp; That mutual
competition is one law of Nature, we see too plainly.&nbsp; But is there
not, besides that law, a law of mutual help?&nbsp; True it is, as the
wise man has said, that the very hyssop on the wall grows there because
all the forces of the universe could not prevent its growing.&nbsp;
All honour to the hyssop.&nbsp; A brave plant, it has fought a brave
fight, and has its just deserts&mdash;as everything in Nature has&mdash;and
so has won.&nbsp; But did all the powers of the universe combine to
prevent it growing?&nbsp; Is not that a one-sided statement of facts?&nbsp;
Did not all the powers of the universe also combine to make it grow,
if only it had valour and worth wherewith to grow?&nbsp; Did not the
rains feed it, the very mortar in the wall give lime to its roots?&nbsp;
Were not electricity, gravitation, and I know not what of chemical and
mechanical forces, busy about the little plant, and every cell of it,
kindly and patiently ready to help it, if it would only help itself?&nbsp;
Surely this is true; true of every organic thing, animal and vegetable,
and mineral, too, for aught I know: and so we must soften our sadness
at the sight of the universal mutual war by the sight of an equally
universal mutual help.</p>
<p>But more.&nbsp; It is true&mdash;too true if you will&mdash;that
all things live on each other.&nbsp; But is it not, therefore, equally
true that all things live for each other?&mdash;that self-sacrifice,
and not selfishness, is at the bottom the law of Nature, as it is the
law of Grace; and the law of bio-geology, as it is the law of all religion
and virtue worthy of the name?&nbsp; Is it not true that everything
has to help something else to live, whether it knows it or not?&mdash;that
not a plant or an animal can turn again to its dust without giving food
and existence to other plants, other animals?&mdash;that the very tiger,
seemingly the most useless tyrant of all tyrants, is still of use, when,
after sending out of the world suddenly, and all but painlessly, many
an animal which would without him have starved in misery through a diseased
old age, he himself dies, and, in dying, gives, by his own carcase,
the means of life and of enjoyment to a thousandfold more living creatures
than ever his paws destroyed?</p>
<p>And so, the longer one watches the great struggle for existence,
the more charitable, the more hopeful, one becomes; as one sees that,
consciously or unconsciously, the law of Nature is, after all, self-sacrifice;
unconscious in plants and animals, as far as we know; save always those
magnificent instances of true self-sacrifice shown by the social insects,
by ants, bees, and others, which put to shame by a civilization truly
noble&mdash;why should I not say divine, for God ordained it?&mdash;the
selfishness and barbarism of man.&nbsp; But be that as it may, in man
the law of self-sacrifice&mdash;whether unconscious or not in the animals&mdash;rises
into consciousness just as far as he is a man; and the crowning lesson
of bio-geology may be, when we have worked it out, after all, the lesson
of Christmas-tide&mdash;of the infinite self-sacrifice of God for man;
and Nature as well as religion may say to us&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ah, could you crush that ever craving lust<br />
For bliss, which kills all bliss, and lose your life,<br />
Your barren unit life, to find again<br />
A thousand times in those for whom you die&mdash;<br />
So were you men and women, and should hold<br />
Your rightful rank in God&rsquo;s great universe,<br />
Wherein, in heaven or earth, by will or nature,<br />
Naught lives for self.&nbsp; All, all, from crown to base&mdash;<br />
The Lamb, before the world&rsquo;s foundation slain&mdash;<br />
The angels, ministers to God&rsquo;s elect&mdash;<br />
The sun, who only shines to light the worlds&mdash;<br />
The clouds, whose glory is to die in showers&mdash;<br />
The fleeting streams, who in their ocean graves<br />
Flee the decay of stagnant self-content&mdash;<br />
The oak, ennobled by the shipwright&rsquo;s axe&mdash;<br />
The soil, which yields its marrow to the flower&mdash;<br />
The flower, which feeds a thousand velvet worms<br />
Born only to be prey to every bird&mdash;<br />
All spend themselves on others: and shall man,<br />
Whose two-fold being is the mystic knot<br />
Which couples earth with heaven, doubly bound,<br />
As being both worm and angel, to that service<br />
By which both worms and angels hold their life,<br />
Shall he, whose every breath is debt on debt,<br />
Refuse, forsooth, to be what God has made him?<br />
No; let him show himself the creatures&rsquo; Lord<br />
By free-will gift of that self-sacrifice<br />
Which they, perforce, by Nature&rsquo;s laws endure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My friends, scientific and others, if the study of bio-geology shall
help to teach you this, or anything like this; I think that though it
may not make you more happy, it may yet make you more wise; and, therefore,
what is better than being more happy, namely, more blessed.</p>
<h2>HEROISM</h2>
<p>It is an open question whether the policeman is not demoralizing
us; and that in proportion as he does his duty well; whether the perfection
of justice and safety, the complete &ldquo;preservation of body and
goods,&rdquo; may not reduce the educated and comfortable classes into
that lap-dog condition in which not conscience, but comfort, doth make
cowards of us all.&nbsp; Our forefathers had, on the whole, to take
care of themselves; we find it more convenient to hire people to take
care of us.&nbsp; So much the better for us, in some respects: but,
it may be, so much the worse in others.&nbsp; So much the better; because,
as usually results from the division of labour, these people, having
little or nothing to do save to take care of us, do so far better than
we could; and so prevent a vast amount of violence and wrong, and therefore
of misery, especially to the weak: for which last reason we will acquiesce
in the existence of policemen and lawyers, as we do in the results of
arbitration, as the lesser of two evils.&nbsp; The odds in war are in
favour of the bigger bully; in arbitration, in favour of the bigger
rogue; and it is a question whether the lion or the fox be the safer
guardian of human interests.&nbsp; But arbitration prevents war: and
that, in three cases out of four, is full reason for employing it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the lap-dog condition, whether in dogs or in men,
is certainly unfavourable to the growth of the higher virtues.&nbsp;
Safety and comfort are good, indeed, for the good; for the brave, the
self-originating, the earnest.&nbsp; They give to such a clear stage
and no favour wherein to work unhindered for their fellow-men.&nbsp;
But for the majority, who are neither brave, self-originating, nor earnest,
but the mere puppets of circumstance, safety and comfort may, and actually
do, merely make their lives mean and petty, effeminate and dull.&nbsp;
Therefore their hearts must be awakened, as often as possible, to take
exercise enough for health; and they must be reminded, perpetually and
importunately, of what a certain great philosopher called &ldquo;whatsoever
things are true, honourable, just, pure, lovely, and of good report;&rdquo;
&ldquo;if there be any manhood, and any just praise, to think of such
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This pettiness and dulness of our modern life is just what keeps
alive our stage, to which people go to see something a little less petty,
a little less dull, than what they see at home.&nbsp; It is, too, the
cause of&mdash;I had almost said the excuse for&mdash;the modern rage
for sensational novels.&nbsp; Those who read them so greedily are conscious,
poor souls, of capacities in themselves of passion and action, for good
and evil, for which their frivolous humdrum daily life gives no room,
no vent.&nbsp; They know too well that human nature can be more fertile,
whether in weeds and poisons, or in flowers and fruits, than it is usually
in the streets and houses of a well-ordered and tolerably sober city.&nbsp;
And because the study of human nature is, after all, that which is nearest
to every one and most interesting to every one, therefore they go to
fiction, since they cannot go to fact, to see what they themselves might
be had they the chance; to see what fantastic tricks before high heaven
men and women like themselves can play; and how they play them.</p>
<p>Well: it is not for me to judge, for me to blame.&nbsp; I will only
say that there are those who cannot read sensational novels, or, indeed,
any novels at all, just because they see so many sensational novels
being enacted round them in painful facts of sinful flesh and blood.&nbsp;
There are those, too, who have looked in the mirror too often to wish
to see their own disfigured visage in it any more; who are too tired
of themselves and ashamed of themselves to want to hear of people like
themselves; who want to hear of people utterly unlike themselves, more
noble, and able, and just, and sweet, and pure; who long to hear of
heroism and to converse with heroes; and who, if by chance they meet
with an heroic act, bathe their spirits in that, as in May-dew, and
feel themselves thereby, if but for an hour, more fair.</p>
<p>If any such shall chance to see these words, let me ask them to consider
with me that one word Hero, and what it means.</p>
<p>Hero; Heroic; Heroism.&nbsp; These words point to a phase of human
nature, the capacity for which we all have in ourselves, which is as
startling and as interesting in its manifestations as any, and which
is always beautiful, always ennobling, and therefore always attractive
to those whose hearts are not yet seared by the world or brutalized
by self-indulgence.</p>
<p>But let us first be sure what the words mean.&nbsp; There is no use
talking about a word till we have got at its meaning.&nbsp; We may use
it as a cant phrase, as a party cry on platforms; we may even hate and
persecute our fellow-men for the sake of it: but till we have clearly
settled in our own minds what a word means, it will do for fighting
with, but not for working with.&nbsp; Socrates of old used to tell the
young Athenians that the ground of all sound knowledge was&mdash;to
understand the true meaning of the words which were in their mouths
all day long; and Socrates was a wiser man than we shall ever see.&nbsp;
So, instead of beginning an oration in praise of heroism, I shall ask
my readers to think with me what heroism is.</p>
<p>Now, we shall always get most surely at the meaning of a word by
getting at its etymology&mdash;that is, at what it meant at first.&nbsp;
And if heroism means behaving like a hero, we must find out, it seems
to me, not merely what a hero may happen to mean just now, but what
it meant in the earliest human speech in which we find it.</p>
<p>A hero or a heroine, then, among the old Homeric Greeks, meant a
man or woman who was like the gods; and who, from that likeness, stood
superior to his or her fellow-creatures.&nbsp; Gods, heroes, and men,
is a threefold division of rational beings, with which we meet more
than once or twice.&nbsp; Those grand old Greeks felt deeply the truth
of the poet&rsquo;s saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Unless above himself he can<br />
Exalt himself, how poor a thing is man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But more: the Greeks supposed these heroes to be, in some way or
other, partakers of a divine nature; akin to the gods; usually, either
they, or some ancestor of theirs, descended from a god or goddess.&nbsp;
Those who have read Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s &lsquo;Juventus Mundi&rsquo;
will remember the section (cap. ix. &sect; 6) on the modes of the approximation
between the divine and the human natures; and whether or not they agree
with the author altogether, all will agree, I think, that the first
idea of a hero or a heroine was a godlike man or godlike woman.</p>
<p>A godlike man.&nbsp; What varied, what infinite forms of nobleness
that word might include, ever increasing, as men&rsquo;s notions of
the gods became purer and loftier, or, alas! decreasing, as their notions
became degraded.&nbsp; The old Greeks, with that intense admiration
of beauty which made them, in after ages, the master sculptors and draughtsmen
of their own, and, indeed, of any age, would, of course, require in
their hero, their godlike man, beauty and strength, manners, too, and
eloquence, and all outward perfections of humanity, and neglect his
moral qualities.&nbsp; Neglect, I say, but not ignore.&nbsp; The hero,
by virtue of his kindred with the gods, was always expected to be a
better man than common men, as virtue was then understood.&nbsp; And
how better?&nbsp; Let us see.</p>
<p>The hero was at least expected to be more reverent than other men
to those divine beings of whose nature he partook, whose society he
might enjoy even here on earth.&nbsp; He might be unfaithful to his
own high lineage; he might misuse his gifts by selfishness and self-will;
he might, like Ajax, rage with mere jealousy and wounded pride till
his rage ended in shameful madness and suicide.&nbsp; He might rebel
against the very gods, and all laws of right and wrong, till he perished
in his &alpha;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&lambda;&iota;&eta;,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Smitten down, blind in his pride, for a sign and
a terror to mortals.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he ought to have, he must have, to be true to his name of Hero,
justice, self-restraint, and &alpha;&iota;&delta;&omega;&sigmaf;&mdash;that
highest form of modesty, for which we have, alas! no name in the English
tongue; that perfect respect for the feelings of others which springs
out of perfect self-respect.&nbsp; And he must have, too&mdash;if he
were to be a hero of the highest type&mdash;the instinct of helpfulness;
the instinct that, if he were a kinsman of the gods, he must fight on
their side, through toil and danger, against all that was unlike them,
and therefore hateful to them.&nbsp; Who loves not the old legends,
unsurpassed for beauty in the literature of any race, in which the hero
stands out as the deliverer, the destroyer of evil?&nbsp; Theseus ridding
the land of robbers, and delivering it from the yearly tribute of boys
and maidens to be devoured by the Minotaur; Perseus slaying the Gorgon,
and rescuing Andromeda from the sea-beast; Heracles with his twelve
famous labours against giants and monsters; and all the rest&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who dared, in the god-given might of their manhood<br />
Greatly to do and to suffer, and far in the fens and the forests<br />
Smite the devourers of men, heaven-hated, brood of the giants;<br />
Transformed, strange, without like, who obey not the golden-haired rulers&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are figures whose divine moral beauty has sunk into the hearts,
not merely of poets or of artists, but of men and women who suffered
and who feared; the memory of them, fables though they may have been,
ennobled the old Greek heart; they ennobled the heart of Europe in the
fifteenth century, at the rediscovery of Greek literature.&nbsp; So
far from contradicting the Christian ideal, they harmonised with&mdash;I
had almost said they supplemented&mdash;that more tender and saintly
ideal of heroism which had sprung up during the earlier Middle Ages.&nbsp;
They justified, and actually gave a new life to, the old noblenesses
of chivalry, which had grown up in the later Middle Ages as a necessary
supplement of active and manly virtue to the passive and feminine virtue
of the cloister.&nbsp; They inspired, mingling with these two other
elements, a literature, both in England, France, and Italy, in which
the three elements, the saintly, the chivalrous, and the Greek heroic,
have become one and undistinguishable, because all three are human,
and all three divine; a literature which developed itself in Ariosto,
in Tasso, in the Hypnerotomachia, the Arcadia, the Euphues, and other
forms, sometimes fantastic, sometimes questionable, but which reached
its perfection in our own Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fairy Queen&rsquo;&mdash;perhaps
the most admirable poem which has ever been penned by mortal man.</p>
<p>And why?&nbsp; What has made these old Greek myths live, myths though
they be, and fables, and fair dreams?&nbsp; What, though they have no
body, and, perhaps, never had, has given them an immortal soul, which
can speak to the immortal souls of all generations to come?</p>
<p>What but this, that in them&mdash;dim it may be and undeveloped,
but still there&mdash;lies the divine idea of self-sacrifice as the
perfection of heroism; of self-sacrifice, as the highest duty and the
highest joy of him who claims a kindred with the gods?</p>
<p>Let us say, then, that true heroism must involve self-sacrifice.&nbsp;
Those stories certainly involve it, whether ancient or modern, which
the hearts, not of philosophers merely, or poets, but of the poorest
and the most ignorant, have accepted instinctively as the highest form
of moral beauty&mdash;the highest form, and yet one possible to all.</p>

And they all had trust in his cussedness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And knew he would keep his word.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; That wouldn&rsquo;t shake hands with him.<br />
He&rsquo;d seen his duty&mdash;a dead sure thing&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And went for it there and then;<br />
And Christ is not going to be too hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a man that died for men.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which gallant poem of Colonel John Hay&rsquo;s&mdash;and he has
written many gallant and beautiful poems&mdash;I have but one demurrer:
Jim Bludso did not merely do his duty, but more than his duty.&nbsp;
He did a voluntary deed, to which he was bound by no code or contract,
civil or moral; just as he who introduced me to that poem won his Victoria
Cross&mdash;as many a cross, Victoria and other, has been won&mdash;by
volunteering for a deed to which he, too, was bound by no code or contract,
military or moral.&nbsp; And it is of the essence of self-sacrifice,
and, therefore, of heroism, that it should be voluntary; a work of supererogation,
at least towards society and man: an act to which the hero or heroine
is not bound by duty, but which is above though not against duty.</p>
<p>Nay, on the strength of that same element of self-sacrifice, I will
not grudge the epithet heroic, which my revered friend Mr. Darwin justly
applies to the poor little monkey, who once in his life did that which
was above his duty; who lived in continual terror of the great baboon,
and yet, when the brute had sprung upon his friend the keeper, and was
tearing out his throat, conquered his fear by love, and, at the risk
of instant death, sprang in turn upon his dreaded enemy, and bit and
shrieked till help arrived.</p>
<p>Some would now-a-days use that story merely to prove that the monkey&rsquo;s
nature and the man&rsquo;s nature are, after all, one and the same.&nbsp;
Well: I, at least, have never denied that there is a monkey-nature in
man as there is a peacock-nature, and a swine-nature, and a wolf-nature&mdash;of
all which four I see every day too much.&nbsp; The sharp and stern distinction
between men and animals, as far as their natures are concerned, is of
a more modern origin than people fancy.&nbsp; Of old the Assyrian took
the eagle, the ox, and the lion&mdash;and not unwisely&mdash;as the
three highest types of human capacity.&nbsp; The horses of Homer might
be immortal, and weep for their master&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The animals
and monsters of Greek myth&mdash;like the Ananzi spider of Negro fable&mdash;glide
insensibly into speech and reason.&nbsp; Birds&mdash;the most wonderful
of all animals in the eyes of a man of science or a poet&mdash;are sometimes
looked on as wiser, and nearer to the gods, than man.&nbsp; The Norseman&mdash;the
noblest and ablest human being, save the Greek, of whom history can
tell us&mdash;was not ashamed to say of the bear of his native forests
that he had &ldquo;ten men&rsquo;s strength and eleven men&rsquo;s wisdom.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How could Reinecke Fuchs have gained immortality, in the Middle Ages
and since, save by the truth of its too solid and humiliating theorem&mdash;that
the actions of the world of men were, on the whole, guided by passions
but too exactly like those of the lower animals?&nbsp; I have said,
and say again, with good old Vaughan&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Unless above himself he can<br />
Exalt himself, how mean a thing is man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I cannot forget that many an old Greek poet or sage, and many
a sixteenth and seventeenth century one, would have interpreted the
monkey&rsquo;s heroism from quite a different point of view; and would
have said that the poor little creature had been visited suddenly by
some &ldquo;divine afflatus&rdquo;&mdash;an expression quite as philosophical
and quite as intelligible as most philosophic formulas which I read
now-a-days&mdash;and had been thus raised for the moment above his abject
selfish monkey-nature, just as man requires to be raised above his.&nbsp;
But that theory belongs to a philosophy which is out of date and out
of fashion, and which will have to wait a century or two before it comes
into fashion again.</p>
<p>And now: if self-sacrifice and heroism be, as I believe, identical,
I must protest against a use of the word sacrifice which is growing
too common in newspaper-columns, in which we are told of an &ldquo;enormous
sacrifice of life;&rdquo; an expression which means merely that a great
many poor wretches have been killed, quite against their own will, and
for no purpose whatsoever: no sacrifice at all, unless it be one to
the demons of ignorance, cupidity or mismanagement.</p>
<p>The stout Whig undergraduate understood better the meaning of such
words, who, when asked, &ldquo;In what sense might Charles the First
be said to be a martyr?&rdquo; answered, &ldquo;In the same sense that
a man might be said to be a martyr to the gout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I must protest, in like wise, against a misuse of the words hero,
heroism, heroic, which is becoming too common, namely, applying them
to mere courage.&nbsp; We have borrowed the misuse, I believe, as we
have more than one beside, from the French press.&nbsp; I trust that
we shall neither accept it, nor the temper which inspires it.&nbsp;
It may be convenient for those who flatter their nation, and especially
the military part of it, into a ruinous self-conceit, to frame some
such syllogism as this&mdash;&ldquo;Courage is heroism: every Frenchman
is naturally courageous: therefore every Frenchman is a hero.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But we, who have been trained at once in a sounder school of morals,
and in a greater respect for facts, and for language as the expression
of facts, shall be careful, I hope, not to trifle thus with that potent
and awful engine&mdash;human speech.&nbsp; We shall eschew likewise,
I hope, a like abuse of the word moral, which has crept from the French
press now and then, not only into our own press, but into the writings
of some of our military men, who, as Englishmen, should have known better.&nbsp;
We were told again and again, during the late war, that the moral effect
of such a success had been great; that the morale of the troops was
excellent; or again, that the morale of the troops had suffered, or
even that they were somewhat demoralised.&nbsp; But when one came to
test what was really meant by these fine words, one discovered that
morals had nothing to do with the facts which they expressed; that the
troops were in the one case actuated simply by the animal passion of
hope, in the other simply by the animal passion of fear.&nbsp; This
abuse of the word moral has crossed, I am sorry to say, the Atlantic;
and a witty American, whom we must excuse, though we must not imitate,
when some one had been blazing away at him with a revolver, he being
unarmed, is said to have described his very natural emotions on the
occasion, by saying that he felt dreadfully demoralised.&nbsp; We, I
hope, shall confine the word demoralisation, as our generals of the
last century would have done, when applied to soldiers, to crime, including,
of course, the neglect of duty or of discipline; and we shall mean by
the word heroism in like manner, whether applied to a soldier or to
any human being, not mere courage; not the mere doing of duty: but the
doing of something beyond duty; something which is not in the bond;
some spontaneous and unexpected act of self-devotion.</p>
<p>I am glad, but not surprised, to see that Miss Yonge has held to
this sound distinction in her golden little book of &lsquo;Golden Deeds;&rsquo;
and said, &ldquo;Obedience, at all costs and risks, is the very essence
of a soldier&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; It has the solid material, but it has
hardly the exceptional brightness, of a golden deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that it is very difficult to draw the line between mere obedience
to duty and express heroism.&nbsp; I know also that it would be both
invidious and impertinent in an utterly unheroic personage like me,
to try to draw that line; and to sit at home at ease, analysing and
criticising deeds which I could not do myself: but&mdash;to give an
instance or two of what I mean&mdash;</p>
<p>To defend a post as long as it is tenable is not heroic.&nbsp; It
is simple duty.&nbsp; To defend it after it has become untenable, and
even to die in so doing, is not heroic, but a noble madness, unless
an advantage is to be gained thereby for one&rsquo;s own side.&nbsp;
Then, indeed, it rises towards, if not into, the heroism of self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Who, for example, will not endorse the verdict of all ages on the
conduct of those Spartans at Thermopyl&aelig;, when they sat &ldquo;combing
their yellow hair for death&rdquo; on the sea-shore?&nbsp; They devoted
themselves to hopeless destruction: but why?&nbsp; They felt&mdash;I
must believe that, for they behaved as if they felt&mdash;that on them
the destinies of the Western World might hang; that they were in the
forefront of the battle between civilisation and barbarism, between
freedom and despotism; and that they must teach that vast mob of Persian
slaves, whom the officers of the Great King were driving with whips
up to their lance-points, that the spirit of the old heroes was not
dead; and that the Greek, even in defeat and death, was a mightier and
a nobler man than they.&nbsp; And they did their work.&nbsp; They produced,
if you will, a &ldquo;moral&rdquo; effect, which has lasted even to
this very day.&nbsp; They struck terror into the heart, not only of
the Persian host, but of the whole Persian empire.&nbsp; They made the
event of that war certain, and the victories of Salamis and Plat&aelig;a
comparatively easy.&nbsp; They made Alexander&rsquo;s conquest of the
East, 150 years afterwards, not only possible at all, but permanent
when it came; and thus helped to determine the future civilisation of
the whole world.</p>
<p>They did not, of course, foresee all this.&nbsp; No great or inspired
man can foresee all the consequences of his deeds: but these men were,
as I hold, inspired to see somewhat at least of the mighty stake for
which they played; and to count their lives worthless, if Sparta had
sent them thither to help in that great game.</p>
<p>Or shall we refuse the name of heroic to those three German cavalry
regiments who, in the battle of Mars La Tour, were bidden to hurl themselves
upon the chassepots and mitrailleuses of the unbroken French infantry,
and went to almost certain death, over the corpses of their comrades,
on and in and through, reeling man over horse, horse over man, and clung
like bull-dogs to their work, and would hardly leave, even at the bugle-call,
till in one regiment thirteen officers out of nineteen were killed or
wounded?&nbsp; And why?</p>
<p>Because the French army must be stopped, if it were but for a quarter
of an hour.&nbsp; A respite must be gained for the exhausted Third Corps.&nbsp;
And how much might be done, even in a quarter of an hour, by men who
knew when, and where, and why to die.&nbsp; Who will refuse the name
of heroes to these men?&nbsp; And yet they, probably, would have utterly
declined the honour.&nbsp; They had but done that which was in the bond.&nbsp;
They were but obeying orders after all.&nbsp; As Miss Yonge well says
of all heroic persons&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;I have but done that which
it was my duty to do,&rsquo; is the natural answer of those capable
of such actions.&nbsp; They have been constrained to them by duty or
pity; have never deemed it possible to act otherwise; and did not once
think of themselves in the matter at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last true words bring us to another element in heroism: its
simplicity.&nbsp; Whatsoever is not simple; whatsoever is affected,
boastful, wilful, covetous, tarnishes, even destroys, the heroic character
of a deed; because all these faults spring out of self.&nbsp; On the
other hand, wherever you find a perfectly simple, frank, unconscious
character, there you have the possibility, at least, of heroic action.&nbsp;
For it is nobler far to do the most commonplace duty in the household,
or behind the counter, with a single eye to duty, simply because it
must be done&mdash;nobler far, I say, than to go out of your way to
attempt a brilliant deed, with a double mind, and saying to yourself
not only&mdash;&ldquo;This will be a brilliant deed,&rdquo; but also&mdash;&ldquo;and
it will pay me, or raise me, or set me off, into the bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Heroism knows no &ldquo;into the bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; And therefore,
again, I must protest against applying the word heroic to any deeds,
however charitable, however toilsome, however dangerous, performed for
the sake of what certain French ladies, I am told, call &ldquo;faire
son salut&rdquo;&mdash;saving one&rsquo;s soul in the world to come.&nbsp;
I do not mean to judge.&nbsp; Other and quite unselfish motives may
be, and doubtless often are, mixed up with that selfish one: womanly
pity and tenderness; love for, and desire to imitate, a certain incarnate
ideal of self-sacrifice, who is at once human and divine.&nbsp; But
that motive of saving the soul, which is too often openly proposed and
proffered, is utterly unheroic.&nbsp; The desire to escape pains and
penalties hereafter by pains and penalties here; the balance of present
loss against future gain&mdash;what is this but selfishness extended
out of this world into eternity?&nbsp; &ldquo;Not worldliness,&rdquo;
indeed, as a satirist once said with bitter truth, &ldquo;but other-worldliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover&mdash;and the young and the enthusiastic should also bear
this in mind&mdash;though heroism means the going beyond the limits
of strict duty, it never means the going out of the path of strict duty.&nbsp;
If it is your duty to go to London, go thither: you may go as much further
as you choose after that.&nbsp; But you must go to London first.&nbsp;
Do your duty first; it will be time after that to talk of being heroic.</p>
<p>And therefore one must seriously warn the young, lest they mistake
for heroism and self-sacrifice what is merely pride and self-will, discontent
with the relations by which God has bound them, and the circumstances
which God has appointed for them.&nbsp; I have known girls think they
were doing a fine thing by leaving uncongenial parents or disagreeable
sisters, and cutting out for themselves, as they fancied, a more useful
and elevated line of life than that of mere home duties; while, after
all, poor things, they were only saying, with the Pharisees of old,
&ldquo;Corban, it is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
by me;&rdquo; and in the name of God, neglecting the command of God
to honour their father and mother.</p>
<p>There are men, too, who will neglect their households and leave their
children unprovided for, and even uneducated, while they are spending
their money on philanthropic or religious hobbies of their own.&nbsp;
It is ill to take the children&rsquo;s bread and cast it to the dogs;
or even to the angels.&nbsp; It is ill, I say, trying to make God presents,
before we have tried to pay God our debts.&nbsp; The first duty of every
man is to the wife whom he has married, and to the children whom she
has brought into the world; and to neglect them is not heroism, but
self-conceit; the conceit that a man is so necessary to Almighty God,
that God will actually allow him to do wrong, if He can only thereby
secure the man&rsquo;s invaluable services.&nbsp; Be sure that every
motive which comes not from the single eye; every motive which springs
from self; is by its very essence unheroic, let it look as gaudy or
as beneficent as it may.</p>
<p>But I cannot go so far as to say the same of the love of approbation&mdash;the
desire for the love and respect of our fellow-men.</p>
<p>That must not be excluded from the list of heroic motives.&nbsp;
I know that it is, or may be proved to be, by victorious analysis, an
emotion common to us and the lower animals.&nbsp; And yet no man excludes
it less than that true hero, St. Paul.&nbsp; If those brave Spartans,
if those brave Germans, of whom I spoke just now, knew that their memories
would be wept over and worshipped by brave men and fair women, and that
their names would become watchwords to children in their fatherland:
what is that to us, save that it should make us rejoice, if we be truly
human, that they had that thought with them in their last moments to
make self-devotion more easy, and death more sweet?</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;is not the highest heroism that which
is free even from the approbation of our fellow-men, even from the approbation
of the best and wisest?&nbsp; The heroism which is known only to our
Father who seeth in secret?&nbsp; The Godlike deeds alone in the lonely
chamber?&nbsp; The Godlike lives lived in obscurity?&mdash;a heroism
rare among us men, who live perforce in the glare and noise of the outer
world: more common among women; women of whom the world never hears;
who, if the world discovered them, would only draw the veil more closely
over their faces and their hearts, and entreat to be left alone with
God.&nbsp; True, they cannot always hide.&nbsp; They must not always
hide; or their fellow-creatures would lose the golden lesson.&nbsp;
But, nevertheless, it is of the essence of the perfect and womanly heroism,
in which, as in all spiritual forces, woman transcends the man, that
it would hide if it could.</p>
<p>And it was a pleasant thought to me, when I glanced lately at the
golden deeds of woman in Miss Yonge&rsquo;s book&mdash;it was a pleasant
thought to me, that I could say to myself&mdash;Ah! yes.&nbsp; These
heroines are known, and their fame flies through the mouths of men.&nbsp;
But if so, how many thousands of heroines there must have been, how
many thousands there may be now, of whom we shall never know.&nbsp;
But still they are there.&nbsp; They sow in secret the seed of which
we pluck the flower and eat the fruit, and know not that we pass the
sower daily in the street; perhaps some humble ill-drest woman, earning
painfully her own small sustenance.&nbsp; She who nurses a bedridden
mother, instead of sending her to the workhouse.&nbsp; She who spends
her heart and her money on a drunken father, a reckless brother, on
the orphans of a kinsman or a friend.&nbsp; She who&mdash;But why go
on with the long list of great little heroisms, with which a clergyman
at least comes in contact daily&mdash;and it is one of the most ennobling
privileges of a clergyman&rsquo;s high calling that he does come in
contact with them&mdash;why go on, I say, save to commemorate one more
form of great little heroism&mdash;the commonest, and yet the least
remembered of all&mdash;namely, the heroism of an average mother?&nbsp;
Ah, when I think of that last broad fact, I gather hope again for poor
humanity; and this dark world looks bright, this diseased world looks
wholesome to me once more&mdash;because, whatever else it is or is not
full of, it is at least full of mothers.</p>
<p>While the satirist only sneers, as at a stock butt for his ridicule,
at the managing mother trying to get her daughters married off her hands
by chicaneries and meannesses, which every novelist knows too well how
to draw&mdash;would to heaven he, or rather, alas! she, would find some
more chivalrous employment for his or her pen&mdash;for were they not,
too, born of woman?&mdash;I only say to myself&mdash;having had always
a secret fondness for poor Rebecca, though I love Esau more than Jacob&mdash;Let
the poor thing alone.&nbsp; With pain she brought these girls into the
world.&nbsp; With pain she educated them according to her light.&nbsp;
With pain she is trying to obtain for them the highest earthly blessing
of which she can conceive, namely, to be well married; and if in doing
that last, she man&oelig;uvres a little, commits a few basenesses, even
tells a few untruths, what does all that come to, save this&mdash;that
in the confused intensity of her motherly self-sacrifice, she will sacrifice
for her daughters even her own conscience and her own credit?&nbsp;
We may sneer, if we will, at such a poor hard-driven soul when we meet
her in society: our duty, both as Christians and ladies and gentlemen,
seems to me to be&mdash;to do for her something very different indeed.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Looking at the amount of great little heroisms,
which are being, as I assert, enacted around us every day, no one has
a right to say, what we are all tempted to say at times&mdash;&ldquo;How
can I be heroic?&nbsp; This is no heroic age, setting me heroic examples.&nbsp;
We are growing more and more comfortable, frivolous, pleasure-seeking,
money-making; more and more utilitarian; more and more mercenary in
our politics, in our morals, in our religion; thinking less and less
of honour and duty, and more and more of loss and gain.&nbsp; I am born
into an unheroic time.&nbsp; You must not ask me to become heroic in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not deny that it is more difficult to be heroic, while circumstances
are unheroic round us.&nbsp; We are all too apt to be the puppets of
circumstance; all too apt to follow the fashion; all too apt, like so
many minnows, to take our colour from the ground on which we lie, in
hopes, like them, of comfortable concealment, lest the new tyrant deity,
called public opinion, should spy us out, and, like Nebuchadnezzar of
old, cast us into a burning fiery furnace&mdash;which public opinion
can make very hot&mdash;for daring to worship any god or man save the
will of the temporary majority.</p>
<p>Yes, it is difficult to be anything but poor, mean, insufficient,
imperfect people, as like each other as so many sheep; and, like so
many sheep, having no will or character of our own, but rushing altogether
blindly over the same gap, in foolish fear of the same dog, who, after
all, dare not bite us; and so it always was and always will be.</p>
<p>For the third time I say,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Unless above himself he can<br />
Exalt himself, how poor a thing is man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, nevertheless, any man or woman who will, in any age and under
any circumstances, can live the heroic life and exercise heroic influences.</p>
<p>If any ask proof of this, I shall ask them, in return, to read two
novels; novels, indeed, but, in their method and their moral, partaking
of that heroic and ideal element, which will make them live, I trust,
long after thousands of mere novels have returned to their native dust.&nbsp;
I mean Miss Muloch&rsquo;s &lsquo;John Halifax, Gentleman,&rsquo; and
Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Esmond,&rsquo; two books which no man or
woman ought to read without being the nobler for them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John Halifax, Gentleman,&rsquo; is simply the history of a
poor young clerk, who rises to be a wealthy mill-owner in the manufacturing
districts, in the early part of this century.&nbsp; But he contrives
to be an heroic and ideal clerk, and an heroic and ideal mill-owner;
and that without doing anything which the world would call heroic or
ideal, or in anywise stepping out of his sphere, minding simply his
own business, and doing the duty which lies nearest him.&nbsp; And how?&nbsp;
By getting into his head from youth the strangest notion, that in whatever
station or business he may be, he can always be what he considers a
gentleman; and that if he only behaves like a gentleman, all must go
right at last.&nbsp; A beautiful book.&nbsp; As I said before, somewhat
of an heroic and ideal book.&nbsp; A book which did me good when first
I read it; which ought to do any young man good who will read it, and
then try to be, like John Halifax, a gentleman, whether in the shop,
the counting-house, the bank, or the manufactory.</p>
<p>The other&mdash;an even more striking instance of the possibility,
at least, of heroism anywhere and everywhere&mdash;is Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Esmond.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the meaning of that book I can speak
with authority.&nbsp; For my dear and regretted friend told me himself
that my interpretation of it was the true one; that this was the lesson
which he meant men to learn therefrom.</p>
<p>Esmond is a man of the first half of the eighteenth century; living
in a coarse, drunken, ignorant, profligate, and altogether unheroic
age.&nbsp; He is&mdash;and here the high art and the high morality of
Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s genius is shown&mdash;altogether a man of his
own age.&nbsp; He is not a sixteenth-century or a nineteenth-century
man born out of time.&nbsp; His information, his politics, his religion,
are no higher than of those round him.&nbsp; His manners, his views
of human life, his very prejudices and faults, are those of his age.&nbsp;
The temptations which he conquers are just those under which the men
around him fall.&nbsp; But how does he conquer them?&nbsp; By holding
fast throughout to honour, duty, virtue.&nbsp; Thus, and thus alone,
he becomes an ideal eighteenth-century gentleman, an eighteenth-century
hero.&nbsp; This was what Mr. Thackeray meant&mdash;for he told me so
himself, I say&mdash;that it was possible, even in England&rsquo;s lowest
and foulest times, to be a gentleman and a hero, if a man would but
be true to the light within him.</p>
<p>But I will go further.&nbsp; I will go from ideal fiction to actual,
and yet ideal, fact; and say that, as I read history, the most unheroic
age which the civilized world ever saw was also the most heroic; that
the spirit of man triumphed most utterly over his circumstances, at
the very moment when those circumstances were most against him.</p>
<p>How and why he did so is a question for philosophy in the highest
sense of that word.&nbsp; The fact of his having done so is matter of
history.&nbsp; Shall I solve my own riddle?</p>
<p>Then, have we not heard of the early Christian martyrs?&nbsp; Is
there a doubt that they, unlettered men, slaves, weak women, even children,
did exhibit, under an infinite sense of duty, issuing in infinite self-sacrifice,
a heroism such as the world had never seen before; did raise the ideal
of human nobleness a whole stage&mdash;rather say, a whole heaven&mdash;higher
than before; and that wherever the tale of their great deeds spread,
men accepted, even if they did not copy, those martyrs as ideal specimens
of the human race, till they were actually worshipped by succeeding
generations, wrongly, it may be, but pardonably, as a choir of lesser
deities?</p>
<p>But is there, on the other hand, a doubt that the age in which they
were heroic was the most unheroic of all ages; that they were bred,
lived, and died, under the most debasing of materialist tyrannies, with
art, literature, philosophy, family and national life dying or dead
around them, and in cities the corruption of which cannot be told for
very shame&mdash;cities, compared with which Paris is the abode of Arcadian
simplicity and innocence?&nbsp; When I read Petronius and Juvenal, and
recollect that they were the contemporaries of the Apostles; when&mdash;to
give an instance which scholars, and perhaps, happily, only scholars,
can appreciate&mdash;I glance once more at Trimalchio&rsquo;s feast,
and remember that within a mile of that feast St. Paul may have been
preaching to a Christian congregation, some of whom&mdash;for St. Paul
makes no secret of that strange fact&mdash;may have been, ere their
conversion, partakers in just such vulgar and bestial orgies as those
which were going on in the rich freedman&rsquo;s halls: after that,
I say, I can put no limit to the possibility of man&rsquo;s becoming
heroic, even though he be surrounded by a hell on earth; no limit to
the capacities of any human being to form for himself or herself a high
and pure ideal of human character; and, without &ldquo;playing fantastic
tricks before high heaven,&rdquo; to carry out that ideal in every-day
life; and in the most commonplace circumstances, and the most menial
occupations, to live worthy of&mdash;as I conceive&mdash;our heavenly
birthright, and to imitate the heroes, who were the kinsmen of the gods.</p>
<h2>SUPERSTITION.&nbsp; A LECTURE DELIVERED AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION,
LONDON.</h2>
<p>Having accepted the very great honour of being allowed to deliver
here two lectures, I have chosen as my subject Superstition and Science.&nbsp;
It is with Superstition that this first lecture will deal.</p>
<p>The subject seems to me especially fit for a clergyman; for he should,
more than other men, be able to avoid trenching on two subjects rightly
excluded from this Institution; namely, Theology&mdash;that is, the
knowledge of God; and Religion&mdash;that is, the knowledge of Duty.&nbsp;
If he knows, as he should, what is Theology, and what is Religion, then
he should best know what is not Theology, and what is not Religion.</p>
<p>For my own part, I entreat you at the outset to keep in mind that
these lectures treat of matters entirely physical; which have in reality,
and ought to have in our minds, no more to do with Theology and Religion
than the proposition that theft is wrong, has to do with the proposition
that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles.</p>
<p>It is necessary to premise this, because many are of opinion that
superstition is a corruption of religion; and though they would agree
that as such, &ldquo;corruptio optimi pessima,&rdquo; yet they would
look on religion as the state of spiritual health, and superstition
as one of spiritual disease.</p>
<p>Others, again, holding the same notion, but not considering that
corruptio optimi pessima, have been in all ages somewhat inclined to
be merciful to superstition, as a child of reverence; as a mere accidental
misdirection of one of the noblest and most wholesome faculties of man.</p>
<p>This is not the place wherein to argue with either of these parties;
and I shall simply say that superstition seems to me altogether a physical
affection, as thoroughly material and corporeal as those of eating or
sleeping, remembering or dreaming.</p>
<p>After this, it will be necessary to define superstition, in order
to have some tolerably clear understanding of what we are talking about.&nbsp;
I beg leave to define it as&mdash;Fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>Johnson, who was no dialectician, and, moreover, superstitious enough
himself, gives eight different definitions of the word; which is equivalent
to confessing his inability to define it at all:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; Unnecessary fear or scruples in religion; observance
of unnecessary and uncommanded rites or practices; religion without
morality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; False religion; reverence of beings not proper objects
of reverence; false worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; Over nicety; exactness too scrupulous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight meanings; which, on the principle that eight eighths, or indeed
800, do not make one whole, may be considered as no definition.&nbsp;
His first thought, as often happens, is the best&mdash;&ldquo;Unnecessary
fear.&rdquo;&nbsp; But after that he wanders.&nbsp; The root-meaning
of the word is still to seek.&nbsp; But, indeed, the popular meaning,
thanks to popular common sense, will generally be found to contain in
itself the root-meaning.</p>
<p>Let us go back to the Latin word Superstitio.&nbsp; Cicero says that
the superstitious element consists in &ldquo;a certain empty dread of
the gods&rdquo;&mdash;a purely physical affection, if you will remember
three things:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That dread is in itself a physical affection.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That the gods who were dreaded were, with the vulgar, who
alone dreaded them, merely impersonations of the powers of nature.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That it was physical injury which these gods were expected
to inflict.</p>
<p>But he himself agrees with this theory of mine; for he says shortly
after, that not only philosophers, but even the ancient Romans, had
separated superstition from religion; and that the word was first applied
to those who prayed all day ut liberi sui sibi superstites essent&mdash;might
survive them.&nbsp; On the etymology no one will depend who knows the
remarkable absence of any etymological instinct in the ancients, in
consequence of their weak grasp of that sound inductive method which
has created modern criticism.&nbsp; But if it be correct, it is a natural
and pathetic form for superstition to take in the minds of men who saw
their children fade and die; probably the greater number of them beneath
diseases which mankind could neither comprehend nor cure.</p>
<p>The best exemplification of what the ancients meant by superstition
is to be found in the lively and dramatic words of Aristotle&rsquo;s
great pupil, Theophrastus.</p>
<p>The superstitious man, according to him, after having washed his
hands with lustral water&mdash;that is, water in which a torch from
the altar had been quenched, goes about with a laurel-leaf in his mouth,
to keep off evil influences, as the pigs in Devonshire used, in my youth,
to go about with a withe of mountain ash round their necks to keep off
the evil eye.&nbsp; If a weasel crosses his path, he stops, and either
throws three pebbles into the road, or, with the innate selfishness
of fear, lets some one else go before him, and attract to himself the
harm which may ensue.&nbsp; He has a similar dread of a screech-owl,
whom he compliments in the name of its mistress, Pallas Athene.&nbsp;
If he finds a serpent in his house, he sets up an altar to it.&nbsp;
If he pass at a four-cross-way an anointed stone, he pours oil on it,
kneels down, and adores it.&nbsp; If a rat has nibbled one of his sacks
he takes it for a fearful portent&mdash;a superstition which Cicero
also mentions.&nbsp; He dare not sit on a tomb, because it would be
assisting at his own funeral.&nbsp; He purifies endlessly his house,
saying that Hecate&mdash;that is, the moon&mdash;has exercised some
malign influence on it; and many other purifications he observes, of
which I shall only say that they are by their nature plainly, like the
last, meant as preservatives against unseen malarias or contagions,
possible or impossible.&nbsp; He assists every month with his children
at the mysteries of the Orphic priests; and finally, whenever he sees
an epileptic patient, he spits in his own bosom to avert the evil omen.</p>
<p>I have quoted, I believe, every fact given by Theophrastus; and you
will agree, I am sure, that the moving and inspiring element of such
a character is mere bodily fear of unknown evil.&nbsp; The only superstition
attributed to him which does not at first sight seem to have its root
in dread is that of the Orphic mysteries.&nbsp; But of them M&uuml;ller
says that the Dionusos whom they worshipped &ldquo;was an infernal deity,
connected with Hades, and was the personification, not merely of rapturous
pleasure, but of a deep sorrow for the miseries of human life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Orphic societies of Greece seem to have been peculiarly ascetic,
taking no animal food save raw flesh from the sacrificed ox of Dionusos.&nbsp;
And Plato speaks of a lower grade of Orphic priests, Orpheotelestai,
&ldquo;who used to come before the doors of the rich, and promise, by
sacrifices and expiatory songs, to release them from their own sins,
and those of their forefathers;&rdquo; and such would be but too likely
to get a hearing from the man who was afraid of a weasel or an owl.</p>
<p>Now, this same bodily fear, I verily believe, will be found at the
root of all superstition whatsoever.</p>
<p>But be it so.&nbsp; Fear is a natural passion, and a wholesome one.&nbsp;
Without the instinct of self-preservation, which causes the sea-anemone
to contract its tentacles, or the fish to dash into its hover, species
would be extermined wholesale by involuntary suicide.</p>
<p>Yes; fear is wholesome enough, like all other faculties, as long
as it is controlled by reason.&nbsp; But what if the fear be not rational,
but irrational?&nbsp; What if it be, in plain homely English, blind
fear; fear of the unknown, simply because it is unknown?&nbsp; Is it
not likely, then, to be afraid of the wrong object? to be hurtful, ruinous
to animals as well as to man?&nbsp; Any one will confess that, who has
ever seen a horse inflict on himself mortal injuries, in his frantic
attempts to escape from a quite imaginary danger.&nbsp; I have good
reasons for believing that not only animals here and there, but whole
flocks and swarms of them, are often destroyed, even in the wild state,
by mistaken fear; by such panics, for instance, as cause a whole herd
of buffalos to rush over a bluff, and be dashed to pieces.&nbsp; And
remark that this capacity of panic, fear&mdash;of superstition, as I
should call it&mdash;is greatest in those animals, the dog and the horse
for instance, which have the most rapid and vivid fancy.&nbsp; Does
not the unlettered Highlander say all that I want to say, when he attributes
to his dog and his horse, on the strength of these very manifestations
of fear, the capacity of seeing ghosts and fairies before he can see
them himself?</p>
<p>But blind fear not only causes evil to the coward himself: it makes
him a source of evil to others; for it is the cruellest of all human
states.&nbsp; It transforms the man into the likeness of the cat, who,
when she is caught in a trap, or shut up in a room, has too low an intellect
to understand that you wish to release her; and, in the madness of terror,
bites and tears at the hand which tries to do her good.&nbsp; Yes; very
cruel is blind fear.&nbsp; When a man dreads he knows not what, he will
do he cares not what.&nbsp; When he dreads desperately, he will act
desperately.&nbsp; When he dreads beyond all reason, he will behave
beyond all reason.&nbsp; He has no law of guidance left, save the lowest
selfishness.&nbsp; No law of guidance: and yet his intellect, left unguided,
may be rapid and acute enough to lead him into terrible follies.&nbsp;
Infinitely more imaginative than the lowest animals, he is for that
very reason capable of being infinitely more foolish, more cowardly,
more superstitious.&nbsp; He can&mdash;what the lower animals, happily
for them, cannot&mdash;organise his folly; erect his superstitions into
a science; and create a whole mythology out of his blind fear of the
unknown.&nbsp; And when he has done that&mdash;Woe to the weak!&nbsp;
For when he has reduced his superstition to a science, then he will
reduce his cruelty to a science likewise, and write books like the Malleus
Maleficarum, and the rest of the witch-literature of the fifteenth,
sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries; of which Mr. Lecky has of late
told the world so much, and told it most faithfully and most fairly.</p>
<p>But, fear of the unknown?&nbsp; Is not that fear of the unseen world?&nbsp;
And is not that fear of the spiritual world?&nbsp; Pardon me: a great
deal of that fear&mdash;all of it, indeed, which is superstition&mdash;is
simply not fear of the spiritual, but of the material; and of nothing
else.</p>
<p>The spiritual world&mdash;I beg you to fix this in your minds&mdash;is
not merely an invisible world which may become visible, but an invisible
world which is by its essence invisible; a moral world, a world of right
and wrong.&nbsp; And spiritual fear&mdash;which is one of the noblest
of all affections, as bodily fear is one of the basest&mdash;is, if
properly defined, nothing less or more than the fear of doing wrong;
of becoming a worse man.</p>
<p>But what has that to do with mere fear of the unseen?&nbsp; The fancy
which conceives the fear is physical, not spiritual.&nbsp; Think for
yourselves.&nbsp; What difference is there between a savage&rsquo;s
fear of a demon, and a hunter&rsquo;s fear of a fall?&nbsp; The hunter
sees a fence.&nbsp; He does not know what is on the other side: but
he has seen fences like it with a great ditch on the other side, and
suspects one here likewise.&nbsp; He has seen horses fall at such, and
men hurt thereby.&nbsp; He pictures to himself his horse falling at
that fence, himself rolling in the ditch, with possibly a broken limb;
and he recoils from the picture he himself has made; and perhaps with
very good reason.&nbsp; His picture may have its counterpart in fact;
and he may break his leg.&nbsp; But his picture, like the previous pictures
from which it was compounded, is simply a physical impression on the
brain, just as much as those in dreams.</p>
<p>Now, does the fact of the ditch, the fall, and the broken leg, being
unseen and unknown, make them a spiritual ditch, a spiritual fall, a
spiritual broken leg?&nbsp; And does the fact of the demon and his doings,
being as yet unseen and unknown, make them spiritual, or the harm that
he may do, a spiritual harm?&nbsp; What does the savage fear?&nbsp;
Lest the demon should appear; that is, become obvious to his physical
senses, and produce an unpleasant physical effect on them.&nbsp; He
fears lest the fiend should entice him into the bog, break the hand-bridge
over the brook, turn into a horse and ride away with him, or jump out
from behind a tree and wring his neck&mdash;tolerably hard physical
facts, all of them; the children of physical fancy, regarded with physical
dread.&nbsp; Even if the superstition proved true; even if the demon
did appear; even if he wrung the traveller&rsquo;s neck in sound earnest,
there would be no more spiritual agency or phenomenon in the whole tragedy
than there is in the parlour table, when spiritual somethings make spiritual
raps upon spiritual wood; and human beings, who are really spirits&mdash;and
would to heaven they would remember that fact, and what it means&mdash;believe
that anything has happened beyond a clumsy juggler&rsquo;s trick.</p>
<p>You demur?&nbsp; Do you not see that the demon, by the mere fact
of having produced physical consequences, would have become himself
a physical agent, a member of physical Nature, and therefore to be explained,
he and his doings, by physical laws?&nbsp; If you do not see that conclusion
at first sight, think over it till you do.</p>
<p>It may seem to some that I have founded my theory on a very narrow
basis; that I am building up an inverted pyramid; or that, considering
the numberless, complex, fantastic shapes which superstition has assumed,
bodily fear is too simple to explain them all.</p>
<p>But if those persons will think a second time, they must agree that
my base is as broad as the phenomena which it explains; for every man
is capable of fear.&nbsp; And they will see, too, that the cause of
superstition must be something like fear, which is common to all men:
for all, at least as children, are capable of superstition; and that
it must be something which, like fear, is of a most simple, rudimentary,
barbaric kind; for the lowest savage, of whatever he is not capable,
is still superstitious, often to a very ugly degree.&nbsp; Superstition
seems, indeed, to be, next to the making of stone-weapons, the earliest
method of asserting his superiority to the brutes which has occurred
to that utterly abnormal and fantastic lusus natur&aelig; called man.</p>
<p>Now let us put ourselves awhile, as far as we can, in the place of
that same savage; and try whether my theory will not justify itself;
whether or not superstition, with all its vagaries, may have been, indeed
must have been, the result of that ignorance and fear which he carried
about with him, every time he prowled for food through the primeval
forest.</p>
<p>A savage&rsquo;s first division of nature would be, I should say,
into things which he can eat, and things which can eat him; including,
of course, his most formidable enemy, and most savoury food&mdash;his
fellow-man.&nbsp; In finding out what he can eat, we must remember,
he will have gone through much experience which will have inspired him
with a serious respect for the hidden wrath of nature; like those Himalayan
folk, of whom Hooker says, that as they know every poisonous plant,
they must have tried them all&mdash;not always with impunity.</p>
<p>So he gets at a third class of objects&mdash;things which he cannot
eat, and which will not eat him; but will only do him harm, as it seems
to him, out of pure malice, like poisonous plants and serpents.&nbsp;
There are natural accidents, too, which fall into the same category,
stones, floods, fires, avalanches.&nbsp; They hurt him or kill him,
surely for ends of their own.&nbsp; If a rock falls from the cliff above
him, what more natural than to suppose that there is some giant up there
who threw it at him?&nbsp; If he had been up there, and strong enough,
and had seen a man walking underneath, he would certainly have thrown
the stone at him and killed him.&nbsp; For first, he might have eaten
the man after; and even if he were not hungry, the man might have done
him a mischief; and it was prudent to prevent that, by doing him a mischief
first.&nbsp; Besides, the man might have a wife; and if he killed the
man, then the wife would, by a very ancient law common to man and animals,
become the prize of the victor.&nbsp; Such is the natural man, the carnal
man, the soulish man, the &alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf; of St. Paul, with
five tolerably acute senses, which are ruled by five very acute animal
passions&mdash;hunger, sex, rage, vanity, fear.&nbsp; It is with the
working of the last passion, fear, that this lecture has to do.</p>
<p>So the savage concludes that there must be a giant living in the
cliff, who threw stones at him, with evil intent; and he concludes in
like wise concerning most other natural phenomena.&nbsp; There is something
in them which will hurt him, and therefore likes to hurt him: and if
he cannot destroy them, and so deliver himself, his fear of them grows
quite boundless.&nbsp; There are hundreds of natural objects on which
he learns to look with the same eyes as the little boys of Teneriffe
look on the useless and poisonous <i>Euphorbia canariensis</i>.&nbsp;
It is to them&mdash;according to Mr. Piazzi Smyth&mdash;a demon who
would kill them, if it could only run after them; but as it cannot,
they shout Spanish curses at it, and pelt it with volleys of stones,
&ldquo;screeching with elfin joy, and using worse names than ever, when
the poisonous milk spurts out from its bruised stalks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if such be the attitude of the uneducated man towards the permanent
terrors of nature, what will it be towards those which are sudden and
seemingly capricious?&mdash;towards storms, earthquakes, floods, blights,
pestilences?&nbsp; We know too well what it has been&mdash;one of blind,
and therefore often cruel, fear.&nbsp; How could it be otherwise?&nbsp;
Was Theophrastus&rsquo;s superstitious man so very foolish for pouring
oil on every round stone?&nbsp; I think there was a great deal to be
said for him.&nbsp; This worship of B&aelig;tyli was rational enough.&nbsp;
They were aerolites, fallen from heaven.&nbsp; Was it not as well to
be civil to such messengers from above?&mdash;to testify by homage to
them due awe of the being who had thrown them at men, and who though
he had missed his shot that time, might not miss it the next?&nbsp;
I think if we, knowing nothing of either gunpowder, astronomy, or Christianity,
saw an Armstrong bolt fall within five miles of London, we should be
inclined to be very respectful to it indeed.&nbsp; So the aerolites,
or glacial boulders, or polished stone weapons of an extinct race, which
looked like aerolites, were the children of Ouranos the heaven, and
had souls in them.&nbsp; One, by one of those strange transformations
in which the logic of unreason indulges, the image of Diana of the Ephesians,
which fell down from Jupiter; another was the Ancile, the holy shield
which fell from the same place in the days of Numa Pompilius, and was
the guardian genius of Rome; and several more became notable for ages.</p>
<p>Why not?&nbsp; The uneducated man of genius, unacquainted alike with
metaphysics and with biology, sees, like a child, a personality in every
strange and sharply-defined object.&nbsp; A cloud like an angel may
be an angel; a bit of crooked root like a man may be a man turned into
wood&mdash;perhaps to be turned back again at its own will.&nbsp; An
erratic block has arrived where it is by strange unknown means.&nbsp;
Is not that an evidence of its personality?&nbsp; Either it has flown
hither itself, or some one has thrown it.&nbsp; In the former case,
it has life, and is proportionally formidable; in the latter, he who
had thrown it is formidable.</p>
<p>I know two erratic blocks of porphyry&mdash;I believe there are three&mdash;in
Cornwall, lying one on serpentine, one, I think, on slate, which&mdash;so
I was always informed as a boy&mdash;were the stones which St. Kevern
threw after St. Just when the latter stole his host&rsquo;s chalice
and paten, and ran away with them to the Land&rsquo;s End.&nbsp; Why
not?&nbsp; Before we knew anything about the action of icebergs and
glaciers, that is, until the last eighty years, that was as good a story
as any other; while how lifelike these boulders are, let a great poet
testify; for the fact has not escaped the delicate eye of Wordsworth:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie<br />
Couched on the bald top of an eminence;<br />
Wonder to all who do the same espy,<br />
By what means it could thither come, and whence,<br />
So that it seems a thing endued with sense;<br />
Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf<br />
Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the civilised poet, the fancy becomes a beautiful simile; to a
savage poet, it would have become a material and a very formidable fact.&nbsp;
He stands in the valley, and looks up at the boulder on the far-off
fells.&nbsp; He is puzzled by it.&nbsp; He fears it.&nbsp; At last he
makes up his mind.&nbsp; It is alive.&nbsp; As the shadows move over
it, he sees it move.&nbsp; May it not sleep there all day, and prowl
for prey all night?&nbsp; He had been always afraid of going up those
fells; now he will never go.&nbsp; There is a monster there.</p>
<p>Childish enough, no doubt.&nbsp; But remember that the savage is
always a child.&nbsp; So, indeed, are millions, as well clothed, housed,
and policed as ourselves&mdash;children from the cradle to the grave.&nbsp;
But of them I do not talk; because, happily for the world, their childishness
is so overlaid by the result of other men&rsquo;s manhood; by an atmosphere
of civilisation and Christianity which they have accepted at second-hand
as the conclusions of minds wiser than their own, that they do all manner
of reasonable things for bad reasons, or for no reason at all, save
the passion of imitation.&nbsp; Not in them, but in the savage, can
we see man as he is by nature, the puppet of his senses and his passions,
the natural slave of his own fears.</p>
<p>But has the savage no other faculties, save his five senses and five
passions?&nbsp; I do not say that.&nbsp; I should be most unphilosophical
if I said it; for the history of mankind proves that he has infinitely
more in him than that.&nbsp; Yes: but in him that infinite more, which
is not only the noblest part of humanity; but, it may be, humanity itself,
is not to be counted as one of the roots of superstition.&nbsp; For
in the savage man, in whom superstition certainly originates, that infinite
more is still merely in him; inside him; a faculty: but not yet a fact.&nbsp;
It has not come out of him into consciousness, purpose, and act; and
is to be treated as non-existent: while what has come out, his passions
and senses, is enough to explain all the vagaries of superstition; a
vera causa for all its phenomena.&nbsp; And if we seem to have found
a sufficient explanation already, it is unphilosophical to look further,
at least till we have tried whether our explanation fits the facts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is another faculty in the savage, to which I
have already alluded, common to him and to at least the higher vertebrates&mdash;fancy;
the power of reproducing internal images of external objects, whether
in its waking form of physical memory&mdash;if, indeed, all memory be
not physical&mdash;or in its sleeping form of dreaming.&nbsp; Upon this
last, which has played so very important a part in superstition in all
ages, I beg you to think a moment.&nbsp; Recollect your own dreams during
childhood; and recollect again that the savage is always a child.&nbsp;
Recollect how difficult it was for you in childhood, how difficult it
must be always for the savage, to decide whether dreams are phantasms
or realities.&nbsp; To the savage, I doubt not, the food he eats, the
foes he grapples with, in dreams, are as real as any waking impressions.&nbsp;
But, moreover, these dreams will be very often, as children&rsquo;s
dreams are wont to be, of a painful and terrible kind.&nbsp; Perhaps
they will be always painful; perhaps his dull brain will never dream,
save under the influence of indigestion, or hunger, or an uncomfortable
attitude.&nbsp; And so, in addition to his waking experience of the
terrors of nature, he will have a whole dream-experience besides, of
a still more terrific kind.&nbsp; He walks by day past a black cavern
mouth, and thinks, with a shudder&mdash;Something ugly may live in that
ugly hole: what if it jumped out upon me?&nbsp; He broods over the thought
with the intensity of a narrow and unoccupied mind; and a few nights
after, he has eaten&mdash;but let us draw a veil before the larder of
a savage&mdash;his chin is pinned down on his chest, a slight congestion
of the brain comes on; and behold he finds himself again at that cavern&rsquo;s
mouth, and something ugly does jump out upon him: and the cavern is
a haunted spot henceforth to him and to all his tribe.&nbsp; It is in
vain that his family tell him that he has been lying asleep at home
all the while.&nbsp; He has the evidence of his senses to prove the
contrary.&nbsp; He must have got out of himself, and gone into the woods.&nbsp;
When we remember that certain wise Greek philosophers could find no
better explanation of dreaming than that the soul left the body, and
wandered free, we cannot condemn the savage for his theory.&nbsp; Now,
I submit that in these simple facts we have a group of &ldquo;true causes&rdquo;
which are the roots of all the superstitions of the world.</p>
<p>And if any one shall complain that I am talking materialism: I shall
answer, that I am doing exactly the opposite.&nbsp; I am trying to eliminate
and get rid of that which is material, animal, and base; in order that
that which is truly spiritual may stand out, distinct and clear, in
its divine and eternal beauty.</p>
<p>To explain, and at the same time, as I think, to verify my hypothesis,
let me give you an example&mdash;fictitious, it is true, but probable
fact nevertheless; because it is patched up of many fragments of actual
fact: and let us see how, in following it out, we shall pass through
almost every possible form of superstition.</p>
<p>Suppose a great hollow tree, in which the formidable wasps of the
tropics have built for ages.&nbsp; The average savage hurries past the
spot in mere bodily fear; for if they come out against him, they will
sting him to death; till at last there comes by a savage wiser than
the rest, with more observation, reflection, imagination, independence
of will&mdash;the genius of his tribe.</p>
<p>The awful shade of the great tree, added to his terror of the wasps,
weighs on him, and excites his brain.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, he has had
a wife or a child stung to death by these same wasps.&nbsp; These wasps,
so small, yet so wise, far wiser than he: they fly, and they sting.&nbsp;
Ah, if he could fly and sting; how he would kill and eat, and live right
merrily.&nbsp; They build great towns; they rob far and wide; they never
quarrel with each other: they must have some one to teach them, to lead
them&mdash;they must have a king.&nbsp; And so he gets the fancy of
a Wasp-King; as the western Irish still believe in the Master Otter;
as the Red Men believe in the King of the Buffalos, and find the bones
of his ancestors in the Mammoth remains of Big-bone Lick; as the Philistines
of Ekron&mdash;to quote a notorious instance&mdash;actually worshipped
Baal-zebub, lord of the flies.</p>
<p>If they have a king, he must be inside that tree, of course.&nbsp;
If he, the savage, were a king, he would not work for his bread, but
sit at home and make others feed him; and so, no doubt, does the wasp-king.</p>
<p>And when he goes home he will brood over this wonderful discovery
of the wasp-king; till, like a child, he can think of nothing else.&nbsp;
He will go to the tree, and watch for him to come out.&nbsp; The wasps
will get accustomed to his motionless figure, and leave him unhurt;
till the new fancy will rise in his mind that he is a favourite of this
wasp-king: and at last he will find himself grovelling before the tree,
saying&mdash;&ldquo;Oh great wasp-king, pity me, and tell your children
not to sting me, and I will bring you honey, and fruit, and flowers
to eat, and I will flatter you, and worship you, and you shall be my
king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he would gradually boast of his discovery; of the new mysterious
bond between him and the wasp-king; and his tribe would believe him,
and fear him; and fear him still more when he began to say, as he surely
would, not merely&mdash;&ldquo;I can ask the wasp-king, and he will
tell his children not to sting you:&rdquo; but&mdash;&ldquo;I can ask
the wasp-king, and he will send his children, and sting you all to death.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Vanity and ambition will have prompted the threat: but it will not be
altogether a lie.&nbsp; The man will more than half believe his own
words; he will quite believe them when he has repeated them a dozen
times.</p>
<p>And so he will become a great man, and a king, under the protection
of the king of the wasps; and he will become, and it may be his children
after him, priest of the wasp-king, who will be their fetish, and the
fetish of their tribe.</p>
<p>And they will prosper, under the protection of the wasp-king.&nbsp;
The wasp will become their moral ideal, whose virtues they must copy.&nbsp;
The new chief will preach to them wild eloquent words.&nbsp; They must
sting like wasps, revenge like wasps, hold all together like wasps,
build like wasps, work hard like wasps, rob like wasps; then, like the
wasps, they will be the terror of all around, and kill and eat all their
enemies.&nbsp; Soon they will call themselves The Wasps.&nbsp; They
will boast that their king&rsquo;s father or grandfather, and soon that
the ancestor of the whole tribe, was an actual wasp; and the wasp will
become at once their eponym hero, their deity, their ideal, their civiliser;
who has taught them to build a kraal of huts, as he taught his children
to build a hive.</p>
<p>Now, if there should come to any thinking man of this tribe, at this
epoch, the new thought&mdash;Who made the world? he will be sorely puzzled.&nbsp;
The conception of a world has never crossed his mind before.&nbsp; He
never pictured to himself anything beyond the nearest ridge of mountains;
and as for a Maker, that will be a greater puzzle still.&nbsp; What
makers or builders more cunning than those wasps of whom his foolish
head is full?&nbsp; Of course, he sees it now.&nbsp; A Wasp made the
world; which to him entirely new guess might become an integral part
of his tribe&rsquo;s creed.&nbsp; That would be their cosmogony.&nbsp;
And if, a generation or two after, another savage genius should guess
that the world was a globe hanging in the heavens, he would, if he had
imagination enough to take the thought in at all, put it to himself
in a form suited to his previous knowledge and conceptions.&nbsp; It
would seem to him that The Wasp flew about the skies with the world
in his mouth, as he carries a bluebottle fly; and that would be the
astronomy of his tribe henceforth.&nbsp; Absurd enough; but&mdash;as
every man who is acquainted with old mythical cosmogonies must know&mdash;no
more absurd than twenty similar guesses on record.&nbsp; Try to imagine
the gradual genesis of such myths as the Egyptian scarab&aelig;us and
egg, or the Hindoo theory that the world stood on an elephant, the elephant
on a tortoise, the tortoise on that infinite note of interrogation which,
as some one expresses it, underlies all physical speculations, and judge:
must they not have arisen in some such fashion as that which I have
pointed out?</p>
<p>This, I say, would be the culminating point of the wasp-worship,
which had sprung up out of bodily fear of being stung.</p>
<p>But times might come for it in which it would go through various
changes, through which every superstition in the world, I suppose, has
passed or is doomed to pass.</p>
<p>The wasp-men might be conquered, and possibly eaten, by a stronger
tribe than themselves.&nbsp; What would be the result?&nbsp; They would
fight valiantly at first, like wasps.&nbsp; But what if they began to
fail?&nbsp; Was not the wasp-king angry with them?&nbsp; Had not he
deserted them?&nbsp; He must be appeased; he must have his revenge.&nbsp;
They would take a captive, and offer him to the wasps.&nbsp; So did
a North American tribe, in their need, some forty years ago; when, because
their maize-crops failed, they roasted alive a captive girl, cut her
to pieces, and sowed her with their corn.&nbsp; I would not tell the
story, for the horror of it, did it not bear with such fearful force
on my argument.&nbsp; What were those Red Men thinking of?&nbsp; What
chain of misreasoning had they in their heads when they hit on that
as a device for making the crops grow?&nbsp; Who can tell?&nbsp; Who
can make the crooked straight, or number that which is wanting?&nbsp;
As said Solomon of old, so must we&mdash;&ldquo;The foolishness of fools
is folly.&rdquo;&nbsp; One thing only we can say of them, that they
were horribly afraid of famine, and took that means of ridding themselves
of their fear.</p>
<p>But what if the wasp-tribe had no captives?&nbsp; They would offer
slaves.&nbsp; What if the agony and death of slaves did not appease
the wasps?&nbsp; They would offer their fairest, their dearest, their
sons and their daughters, to the wasps; as the Carthaginians, in like
strait, offered in one day 200 noble boys to Moloch, the volcano-god,
whose worship they had brought out of Syria; whose original meaning
they had probably forgotten; of whom they only knew that he was a dark
and devouring being, who must be appeased with the burning bodies of
their sons and daughters.&nbsp; And so the veil of fancy would be lifted
again, and the whole superstition stand forth revealed as the mere offspring
of bodily fear.</p>
<p>But more; the survivors of the conquest might, perhaps, escape, and
carry their wasp-fetish into a new land.&nbsp; But if they became poor
and weakly, their brains and imagination, degenerating with their bodies,
would degrade their wasp-worship till they knew not what it meant.&nbsp;
Away from the sacred tree, in a country the wasps of which were not
so large or formidable, they would require a remembrancer of the wasp-king;
and they would make one&mdash;a wasp of wood, or what not.&nbsp; After
a while, according to that strange law of fancy, the root of all idolatry,
which you may see at work in every child who plays with a doll, the
symbol would become identified with the thing symbolised; they would
invest the wooden wasp with all the terrible attributes which had belonged
to the live wasps of the tree; and after a few centuries, when all remembrance
of the tree, the wasp-prophet and chieftain, and his descent from the
divine wasp&mdash;aye, even of their defeat and flight&mdash;had vanished
from their songs and legends, they would be found bowing down in fear
and trembling to a little ancient wooden wasp, which came from they
knew not whence, and meant they knew not what, save that it was a very
&ldquo;old fetish,&rdquo; a &ldquo;great medicine,&rdquo; or some such
other formula for expressing their own ignorance and dread.&nbsp; Just
so do the half-savage natives of Thibet, and the Irishwomen of Kerry,
by a strange coincidence&mdash;unless the ancient Irish were Buddhists,
like the Himalayans&mdash;tie just the same scraps of rag on arise,
and show men that they are not the puppets of Nature, but her lords;
and that they are to fear God, and fear naught else.</p>
<p>And so ends my true myth of the wasp-tree.&nbsp; No, it need not
end there; it may develop into a yet darker and more hideous form of
superstition, which Europe has often seen; which is common now among
the Negros; <a name="citation256"></a><a href="#footnote256">{256}</a>
which, we may hope, will soon be exterminated.</p>
<p>This might happen.&nbsp; For it, or something like it, has happened
too many times already.</p>
<p>That to the ancient women who still kept up the irrational remnant
of the wasp-worship, beneath the sacred tree, other women might resort;
not merely from curiosity, or an excited imagination, but from jealousy
and revenge.&nbsp; Oppressed, as woman has always been under the reign
of brute force; beaten, outraged, deserted, at best married against
her will, she has too often gone for comfort and help&mdash;and those
of the very darkest kind&mdash;to the works of darkness; and there never
were wanting&mdash;there are not wanting, even now, in remote parts
of these isles&mdash;wicked old women who would, by help of the old
superstitions, do for her what she wished.&nbsp; Soon would follow mysterious
deaths of rivals, of husbands, of babes; then rumours of dark rites
connected with the sacred tree, with poison, with the wasp and his sting,
with human sacrifices; lies mingled with truth, more and more confused
and frantic, the more they were misinvestigated by men mad with fear:
till there would arise one of those witch-manias, which are too common
still among the African Negros, which were too common of old among the
men of our race.</p>
<p>I say, among the men.&nbsp; To comprehend a witch-mania, you must
look at it as&mdash;what the witch-literature confesses it unblushingly
to be&mdash;man&rsquo;s dread of Nature excited to its highest form,
as dread of woman.</p>
<p>She is to the barbarous man&mdash;she should be more and more to
the civilised man&mdash;not only the most beautiful and precious, but
the most wonderful and mysterious of all natural objects, if it be only
as the author of his physical being.&nbsp; She is to the savage a miracle
to be alternately adored and dreaded.&nbsp; He dreads her more delicate
nervous organisation, which often takes shapes to him demoniacal and
miraculous; her quicker instincts, her readier wit, which seem to him
to have in them somewhat prophetic and superhuman, which entangle him
as in an invisible net, and rule him against his will.&nbsp; He dreads
her very tongue, more crushing than his heaviest club, more keen than
his poisoned arrows.&nbsp; He dreads those habits of secresy and falsehood,
the weapons of the weak, to which savage and degraded woman always has
recourse.&nbsp; He dreads the very medicinal skill which she has learnt
to exercise, as nurse, comforter, and slave.&nbsp; He dreads those secret
ceremonies, those mysterious initiations which no man may witness, which
he has permitted to her in all ages, in so many&mdash;if not all&mdash;barbarous
and semi-barbarous races, whether Negro, American, Syrian, Greek, or
Roman, as a homage to the mysterious importance of her who brings him
into the world.&nbsp; If she turn against him&mdash;she, with all her
unknown powers, she who is the sharer of his deepest secrets, who prepares
his very food day by day&mdash;what harm can she not, may she not do?&nbsp;
And that she has good reason to turn against him, he knows too well.&nbsp;
What deliverance is there from this mysterious house-fiend, save brute
force?&nbsp; Terror, torture, murder, must be the order of the day.&nbsp;
Woman must be crushed, at all price, by the blind fear of the man.</p>
<p>I shall say no more.&nbsp; I shall draw a veil, for very pity and
shame, over the most important and most significant facts of this, the
most hideous of all human follies.&nbsp; I have, I think, given you
hints enough to show that it, like all other superstitions, is the child&mdash;the
last born and the ugliest child&mdash;of blind dread of the unknown.</p>
<h2>SCIENCE: A lecture delivered at the Royal Institution.</h2>
<p>I said, that Superstition was the child of Fear, and Fear the child
of Ignorance; and you might expect me to say antithetically, that Science
was the child of Courage, and Courage the child of Knowledge.</p>
<p>But these genealogies&mdash;like most metaphors&mdash;do not fit
exactly, as you may see for yourselves.</p>
<p>If fear be the child of ignorance, ignorance is also the child of
fear; the two react on, and produce each other.&nbsp; The more men dread
Nature, the less they wish to know about her.&nbsp; Why pry into her
awful secrets?&nbsp; It is dangerous; perhaps impious.&nbsp; She says
to them, as in the Egyptian temple of old&mdash;&ldquo;I am Isis, and
my veil no mortal yet hath lifted.&rdquo;&nbsp; And why should they
try or wish to lift it?&nbsp; If she will leave them in peace, they
will leave her in peace.&nbsp; It is enough that she does not destroy
them.&nbsp; So as ignorance bred fear, fear breeds fresh and willing
ignorance.</p>
<p>And courage?&nbsp; We may say, and truly, that courage is the child
of knowledge.&nbsp; But we may say as truly, that knowledge is the child
of courage.&nbsp; Those Egyptian priests in the temple of Isis would
have told you that knowledge was the child of mystery, of special illumination,
of reverence, and what not; hiding under grand words their purpose of
keeping the masses ignorant, that they might be their slaves.&nbsp;
Reverence?&nbsp; I will yield to none in reverence for reverence.&nbsp;
I will all but agree with the wise man who said that reverence is the
root of all virtues.&nbsp; But which child reverences his father most?&nbsp;
He who comes joyfully and trustfully to meet him, that he may learn
his father&rsquo;s mind, and do his will: or he who at his father&rsquo;s
coming runs away and hides, lest he should be beaten for he knows not
what?&nbsp; There is a scientific reverence, a reverence of courage,
which is surely one of the highest forms of reverence.&nbsp; That, namely,
which so reveres every fact, that it dare not overlook or falsify it,
seem it never so minute; which feels that because it is a fact, it cannot
be minute, cannot be unimportant; that it must be a fact of God; a message
from God; a voice of God, as Bacon has it, revealed in things; and which
therefore, just because it stands in solemn awe of such paltry facts
as the Scolopax feather in a snipe&rsquo;s pinion, or the jagged leaves
which appear capriciously in certain honeysuckles, believes that there
is likely to be some deep and wide secret underlying them, which is
worth years of thought to solve.&nbsp; That is reverence; a reverence
which is growing, thank God, more and more common; which will produce,
as it grows more common still, fruit which generations yet unborn shall
bless.</p>
<p>But as for that other reverence, which shuts its eyes and ears in
pious awe&mdash;what is it but cowardice decked out in state robes,
putting on the sacred Urim and Thummim, not that men may ask counsel
of the Deity, but that they may not?&nbsp; What is it but cowardice,
very pitiable when unmasked; and what is its child but ignorance as
pitiable, which would be ludicrous were it not so injurious?&nbsp; If
a man comes up to Nature as to a parrot or a monkey, with this prevailing
thought in his head&mdash;Will it bite me?&mdash;will he not be pretty
certain to make up his mind that it may bite him, and had therefore
best be left alone?&nbsp; It is only the man of courage&mdash;few and
far between&mdash;who will stand the chance of a first bite, in the
hope of teaching the parrot to talk, or the monkey to fire off a gun.&nbsp;
And it is only the man of courage&mdash;few and far between&mdash;who
will stand the chance of a first bite from Nature, which may kill him
for aught he knows&mdash;for her teeth, though clumsy, are very strong&mdash;in
order that he may tame her and break her in to his use by the very same
method by which that admirable inductive philosopher, Mr. Rarey, used
to break in his horses; first, by not being afraid of them; and next,
by trying to find out what they were thinking of.&nbsp; But after all,
as with animals, so with Nature; cowardice is dangerous.&nbsp; The surest
method of getting bitten by an animal is to be afraid of it; and the
surest method of being injured by Nature is to be afraid of it.&nbsp;
Only as far as we understand Nature are we safe from it; and those who
in any age counsel mankind not to pry into the secrets of the universe,
counsel them not to provide for their own life and well-being, or for
their children after them.&nbsp; But how few there have been in any
age who have not been afraid of Nature.&nbsp; How few have set themselves,
like Rarey, to tame her by finding out what she is thinking of.&nbsp;
The mass are glad to have the results of science, as they are to buy
Mr. Rarey&rsquo;s horses after they are tamed: but for want of courage
or of wit, they had rather leave the taming process to some one else.&nbsp;
And therefore we may say that what knowledge of Nature we have&mdash;and
we have very little&mdash;we owe to the courage of those men&mdash;and
they have been very few&mdash;who have been inspired to face Nature
boldly; and say&mdash;or, what is better, act as if they were saying&mdash;&ldquo;I
find something in me which I do not find in you; which gives me the
hope that I can grow to understand you, though you may not understand
me; that I may become your master, and not as now, you mine.&nbsp; And
if not, I will know: or die in the search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is to those men, the few and far between, in a very few ages and
very few countries, who have thus risen in rebellion against Nature,
and looked it in the face with an unquailing glance, that we owe what
we call Physical Science.</p>
<p>There have been four races&mdash;or rather a very few men of each
four races&mdash;who have faced Nature after this gallant wise.</p>
<p>First, the old Jews.&nbsp; I speak of them, be it remembered, exclusively
from an historical, and not a religious point of view.</p>
<p>These people, at a very remote epoch, emerged from a country highly
civilised, but sunk in the superstitions of nature-worship.&nbsp; They
invaded and mingled with tribes whose superstitions were even more debased,
silly, and foul than those of the Egyptians from whom they escaped.&nbsp;
Their own masses were for centuries given up to nature-worship.&nbsp;
Now among those Jews arose men&mdash;a very few&mdash;sages&mdash;prophets&mdash;call
them what you will, the men were inspired heroes and philosophers&mdash;who
assumed towards nature an attitude utterly different from the rest of
their countrymen and the rest of the then world; who denounced superstition
and the dread of nature as the parent of all manner of vice and misery;
who for themselves said boldly that they discerned in the universe an
order, a unity, a permanence of law, which gave them courage instead
of fear.&nbsp; They found delight and not dread in the thought that
the universe obeyed a law which could not be broken; that all things
continued to that day according to a certain ordinance.&nbsp; They took
a view of Nature totally new in that age; healthy, human, cheerful,
loving, trustful, and yet reverent&mdash;identical with that which happily
is beginning to prevail in our own day.&nbsp; They defied those very
volcanic and meteoric phenomena of their land, to which their countrymen
were slaying their own children in the clefts of the rocks, and, like
Theophrastus&rsquo; superstitious man, pouring their drink-offerings
on the smooth stones of the valley; and declared that, for their part,
they would not fear, though the earth was moved, and though the hills
were carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters raged and
swelled, and the mountains shook at the tempest.</p>
<p>The fact is indisputable.&nbsp; And you must pardon me if I express
my belief that these men, if they had felt it their business to found
a school of inductive physical science, would, owing to that temper
of mind, have achieved a very signal success.&nbsp; I ground that opinion
on the remarkable, but equally indisputable fact, that no nation has
ever succeeded in perpetuating a school of inductive physical science,
save those whose minds have been saturated with this same view of Nature,
which they have&mdash;as an historic fact&mdash;slowly but thoroughly
learnt from the writings of these Jewish sages.</p>
<p>Such is the fact.&nbsp; The founders of inductive physical science
were not the Jews: but first the Chald&aelig;ans, next the Greeks, next
their pupils the Romans&mdash;or rather a few sages among each race.&nbsp;
But what success had they?&nbsp; The Chald&aelig;an astronomers made
a few discoveries concerning the motions of the heavenly bodies, which,
rudimentary as they were, still prove them to have been men of rare
intellect.&nbsp; For a great and a patient genius must he have been,
who first distinguished the planets from the fixed stars, or worked
out the earliest astronomical calculation.&nbsp; But they seem to have
been crushed, as it were, by their own discoveries.&nbsp; They stopped
short.&nbsp; They gave way again to the primeval fear of Nature.&nbsp;
They sank into planet-worship.&nbsp; They invented, it would seem, that
fantastic pseudo-science of astrology, which lay for ages after as an
incubus on the human intellect and conscience.&nbsp; They became the
magicians and quacks of the old world; and mankind owed them thenceforth
nothing but evil.&nbsp; Among the Greeks and Romans, again, those sages
who dared face Nature like reasonable men, were accused by the superstitious
mob as irreverent, impious, atheists.&nbsp; The wisest of them all,
Socrates, was actually put to death on that charge; and finally, they
failed.&nbsp; School after school, in Greece and Rome, struggled to
discover, and to get a hearing for, some theory of the universe which
was founded on something like experience, reason, common sense.&nbsp;
They were not allowed to prosecute their attempt.&nbsp; The mud-ocean
of ignorance and fear in which they struggled so manfully was too strong
for them; the mud-waves closed over their heads finally, as the age
of the Antonines expired; and the last effort of Gr&aelig;co-Roman thought
to explain the universe was Neoplatonism&mdash;the muddiest of the muddy&mdash;an
attempt to apologise for, and organise into a system, all the nature-dreading
superstitions of the Roman world.&nbsp; Porphyry, Plotinus, Proclus,
poor Hypatia herself, and all her school&mdash;they may have had themselves
no bodily fear of Nature; for they were noble souls.&nbsp; Yet they
spent their time in justifying those who had; in apologising for the
superstitions of the very mob which they despised: just as&mdash;it
sometimes seems to me&mdash;some folk in these days are like to end
in doing; begging that the masses might be allowed to believe in anything,
however false, lest they should believe in nothing at all: as if believing
in lies could do anything but harm to any human being.&nbsp; And so
died the science of the old world, in a true second childhood, just
where it began.</p>
<p>The Jewish sages, I hold, taught that science was probable; the Greeks
and Romans proved that it was possible.&nbsp; It remained for our race,
under the teaching of both, to bring science into act and fact.</p>
<p>Many causes contributed to give them this power.&nbsp; They were
a personally courageous race.&nbsp; This earth has yet seen no braver
men than the forefathers of Christian Europe, whether Scandinavian or
Teuton, Angle or Frank.&nbsp; They were a practical hard-headed race,
with a strong appreciation of facts, and a strong determination to act
on them.&nbsp; Their laws, their society, their commerce, their colonisation,
their migrations by land and sea, proved that they were such.&nbsp;
They were favoured, moreover, by circumstances, or&mdash;as I should
rather put it&mdash;by that divine Providence which determined their
times, and the bounds of their habitation.&nbsp; They came in as the
heritors of the decaying civilisation of Greece and Rome; they colonised
territories which gave to man special fair play, but no more, in the
struggle for existence, the battle with the powers of Nature; tolerably
fertile, tolerably temperate; with boundless means of water communication;
freer than most parts of the world from those terrible natural phenomena,
like the earthquake and the hurricane, before which man lies helpless
and astounded, a child beneath the foot of a giant.&nbsp; Nature was
to them not so inhospitable as to starve their brains and limbs, as
it has done for the Esquimaux or Fuegian; and not so bountiful as to
crush them by its very luxuriance, as it has crushed the savages of
the tropics.&nbsp; They saw enough of its strength to respect it; not
enough to cower before it: and they and it have fought it out; and it
seems to me, standing either on London Bridge or on a Holland fen-dyke,
that they are winning at last.&nbsp; But they had a sore battle: a battle
against their own fear of the unseen.&nbsp; They brought with them,
out of the heart of Asia, dark and sad nature-superstitions, some of
which linger among our peasantry till this day, of elves, trolls, nixes,
and what not.&nbsp; Their Thor and Odin were at first, probably, only
the thunder and the wind: but they had to be appeased in the dark marches
of the forest, where hung rotting on the sacred oaks, amid carcases
of goat and horse, the carcases of human victims.&nbsp; No one acquainted
with the early legends and ballads of our race, but must perceive throughout
them all the prevailing tone of fear and sadness.&nbsp; And to their
own superstitions, they added those of the Rome which they conquered.&nbsp;
They dreaded the Roman she-poisoners and witches, who, like Horace&rsquo;s
Canidia, still performed horrid rites in grave-yards and dark places
of the earth.&nbsp; They dreaded as magical the delicate images engraved
on old Greek gems.&nbsp; They dreaded the very Roman cities they had
destroyed.&nbsp; They were the work of enchanters.&nbsp; Like the ruins
of St. Albans here in England, they were all full of devils, guarding
the treasures which the Romans had hidden.&nbsp; The C&aelig;sars became
to them magical man-gods.&nbsp; The poet Virgil became the prince of
necromancers.&nbsp; If the secrets of Nature were to be known, they
were to be known by unlawful means, by prying into the mysteries of
the old heathen magicians, or of the Mohammedan doctors of Cordova and
Seville; and those who dared to do so were respected and feared, and
often came to evil ends.&nbsp; It needed moral courage, then, to face
and interpret fact.&nbsp; Such brave men as Pope Gerbert, Roger Bacon,
Galileo, even Kepler, did not lead happy lives; some of them found themselves
in prison.&nbsp; All the medieval sages&mdash;even Albertus Magnus&mdash;were
stigmatised as magicians.&nbsp; One wonders that more of them did not
imitate poor Paracelsus, who, unable to get a hearing for his coarse
common sense, took&mdash;vain and sensual&mdash;to drinking the laudanum
which he himself had discovered, and vaunted as a priceless boon to
men; and died as the fool dieth, in spite of all his wisdom.&nbsp; For
the &ldquo;Romani nominis umbra,&rdquo; the shadow of the mighty race
whom they had conquered, lay heavy on our forefathers for centuries.&nbsp;
And their dread of the great heathens was really a dread of Nature,
and of the powers thereof.&nbsp; For when the authority of great names
has reigned unquestioned for many centuries, those names become, to
the human mind, integral and necessary parts of Nature itself.&nbsp;
They are, as it were, absorbed into it; they become its laws, its canons,
its demiurges, and guardian spirits; their words become regarded as
actual facts; in one word, they become a superstition, and are feared
as parts of the vast unknown; and to deny what they have said is, in
the minds of the many, not merely to fly in the face of reverent wisdom,
but to fly in the face of facts.&nbsp; During a great part of the middle
ages, for instance, it was impossible for an educated man to think of
Nature itself, without thinking first of what Aristotle had said of
her.&nbsp; Aristotle&rsquo;s dicta were Nature; and when Benedetti,
at Venice, opposed in 1585 Aristotle&rsquo;s opinions on violent and
natural motion, there were hundreds, perhaps, in the universities of
Europe&mdash;as there certainly were in the days of the immortal &lsquo;Epistol&aelig;
Obscurorum Virorum&rsquo;&mdash;who were ready, in spite of all Benedetti&rsquo;s
professed reverence for Aristotle, to accuse him of outraging not only
the father of philosophy, but Nature itself and its palpable and notorious
facts.&nbsp; For the restoration of letters in the fifteenth century
had not at first mended matters, so strong was the dread of Nature in
the minds of the masses.&nbsp; The minds of men had sported forth, not
toward any sound investigation of facts, but toward an eclectic resuscitation
of Neoplatonism; which endured, not without a certain beauty and use&mdash;as
let Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faery Queen&rsquo; bear witness&mdash;till
the latter half of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>After that time a rapid change began.&nbsp; It is marked by&mdash;it
has been notably assisted by&mdash;the foundation of our own Royal Society.&nbsp;
Its causes I will not enter into; they are so inextricably mixed, I
hold, with theological questions, that they cannot be discussed here.&nbsp;
I will only point out to you these facts: that, from the latter part
of the seventeenth century, the noblest heads and the noblest hearts
of Europe concentrated themselves more and more on the brave and patient
investigation of physical facts, as the source of priceless future blessings
to mankind; that the eighteenth century, which it has been the fashion
of late to depreciate, did more for the welfare of mankind, in every
conceivable direction, than the whole fifteen centuries before it; that
it did this good work by boldly observing and analysing facts; that
this boldness toward facts increased in proportion as Europe became
indoctrinated with the Jewish literature; and that, notably, such men
as Kepler, Newton, Berkeley, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Descartes, in whatsoever
else they differed, agreed in this, that their attitude towards Nature
was derived from the teaching of the Jewish sages.&nbsp; I believe that
we are not yet fully aware how much we owe to the Jewish mind, in the
gradual emancipation of the human intellect.&nbsp; The connection may
not, of course, be one of cause and effect; it may be a mere coincidence.&nbsp;
I believe it to be a cause; one of course of very many causes: but still
an integral cause.&nbsp; At least the coincidence is too remarkable
a fact not to be worthy of investigation.</p>
<p>I said, just now&mdash;The emancipation of the human intellect.&nbsp;
I did not say&mdash;Of science, or of the scientific intellect; and
for this reason:</p>
<p>That the emancipation of science is the emancipation of the common
mind of all men.&nbsp; All men can partake of the gains of free scientific
thought, not merely by enjoying its physical results, but by becoming
more scientific men themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore it was, that though I began my first lecture by defining
superstition, I did not begin my second by defining its antagonist,
science.&nbsp; For the word science defines itself.&nbsp; It means simply
knowledge; that is, of course, right knowledge, or such an approximation
as can be obtained; knowledge of any natural object, its classification,
its causes, its effects; or in plain English, what it is, how it came
where it is, and what can be done with it.</p>
<p>And scientific method, likewise, needs no definition; for it is simply
the exercise of common sense.&nbsp; It is not a peculiar, unique, professional,
or mysterious process of the understanding: but the same which all men
employ, from the cradle to the grave, in forming correct conclusions.</p>
<p>Every one who knows the philosophic writings of Mr. John Stuart Mill,
will be familiar with this opinion.&nbsp; But to those who have no leisure
to study him, I should recommend the reading of Professor Huxley&rsquo;s
third lecture on the origin of species.</p>
<p>In that he shows, with great logical skill, as well as with some
humour, how the man who, on rising in the morning, finds the parlour
window open, the spoons and teapot gone, the mark of a dirty hand on
the window-sill, and that of a hob-nailed boot outside, and comes to
the conclusion that some one has broken open the window and stolen the
plate, arrives at that hypothesis&mdash;for it is nothing more&mdash;by
a long and complex train of inductions and deductions, of just the same
kind as those which, according to the Baconian philosophy, are to be
used for investigating the deepest secrets of Nature.</p>
<p>This is true, even of those sciences which involve long mathematical
calculations.&nbsp; In fact, the stating of the problem to be solved
is the most important element in the calculation; and that is so thoroughly
a labour of common sense that an utterly uneducated man may, and often
does, state an abstruse problem clearly and correctly; seeing what ought
to be proved, and perhaps how to prove it, though he may be unable to
work the problem out, for want of mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>But that mathematical knowledge is not&mdash;as all Cambridge men
are surely aware&mdash;the result of any special gift.&nbsp; It is merely
the development of those conceptions of form and number which every
human being possesses; and any person of average intellect can make
himself a fair mathematician if he will only pay continuous attention;
in plain English, think enough about the subject.</p>
<p>There are sciences, again, which do not involve mathematical calculation;
for instance, botany, zoology, geology, which are just now passing from
their old stage of classificatory sciences into the rank of organic
ones.&nbsp; These are, without doubt, altogether within the scope of
the merest common sense.&nbsp; Any man or woman of average intellect,
if they will but observe and think for themselves, freely, boldly, patiently,
accurately, may judge for themselves of the conclusions of these sciences,
may add to these conclusions fresh and important discoveries; and if
I am asked for a proof of what I assert, I point to &lsquo;Rain and
Rivers,&rsquo; written by no professed scientific man, but by a colonel
in the Guards, known to fame only as one of the most perfect horsemen
in the world.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate my meaning by an example.&nbsp; A man&mdash;I do
not say a geologist, but simply a man, squire or ploughman&mdash;sees
a small valley, say one of the side-glens which open into the larger
valleys in the Windsor forest district.&nbsp; He wishes to ascertain
its age.</p>
<p>He has, at first sight, a very simple measure&mdash;that of denudation.&nbsp;
He sees that the glen is now being eaten out by a little stream, the
product of innumerable springs which arise along its sides, and which
are fed entirely by the rain on the moors above.&nbsp; He finds, on
observation, that this stream brings down some ten cubic yards of sand
and gravel, on an average, every year.&nbsp; The actual quantity of
earth which has been removed to make the glen may be several million
cubic yards.&nbsp; Here is an easy sum in arithmetic.&nbsp; At the rate
of ten cubic yards a year, the stream has taken several hundred thousand
years to make the glen.</p>
<p>You will observe that this result is obtained by mere common sense.&nbsp;
He has a right to assume that the stream originally began the glen,
because he finds it in the act of enlarging it; just as much right as
he has to assume, if he finds a hole in his pocket, and his last coin
in the act of falling through it, that the rest of his money has fallen
through the same hole.&nbsp; It is a sufficient cause, and the simplest.&nbsp;
A number of observations as to the present rate of denudation, and a
sum which any railroad contractor can do in his head, to determine the
solid contents of the valley, are all that are needed.&nbsp; The method
is that of science: but it is also that of simple common sense.&nbsp;
You will remember, therefore, that this is no mere theory or hypothesis,
but a pretty fair and simple conclusion from palpable facts; that the
probability lies with the belief that the glen is some hundreds of thousands
of years old; that it is not the observer&rsquo;s business to prove
it further, but other persons&rsquo; to disprove it, if they can.</p>
<p>But does the matter end here?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; And, for certain reasons,
it is good that it should not end here.</p>
<p>The observer, if he be a cautious man, begins to see if he can disprove
his own conclusion; moreover, being human, he is probably somewhat awed,
if not appalled, by his own conclusion.&nbsp; Hundreds of thousands
of years spent in making that little glen!&nbsp; Common sense would
say that the longer it took to make, the less wonder there was in its
being made at last: but the instinctive human feeling is the opposite.&nbsp;
There is in men, and there remains in them, even after they are civilised,
and all other forms of the dread of Nature have died out in them, a
dread of size, of vast space, of vast time; that latter, mind, being
always imagined as space, as we confess when we speak instinctively
of a space of time.&nbsp; They will not understand that size is merely
a relative, not an absolute term; that if we were a thousand times larger
than we are, the universe would be a thousand times smaller than it
is; that if we could think a thousand times faster than we do, time
would be a thousand times longer than it is; that there is One in whom
we live, and move, and have our being, to whom one day is as a thousand
years, and a thousand years as one day.&nbsp; I believe this dread of
size to be merely, like all other superstitions, a result of bodily
fear; a development of the instinct which makes a little dog run away
from a big dog.&nbsp; Be that as it may, every observer has it; and
so the man&rsquo;s conclusion seems to him strange, doubtful: he will
reconsider it.</p>
<p>Moreover, if he be an experienced man, he is well aware that first
guesses, first hypotheses, are not always the right ones; and if he
be a modest man, he will consider the fact that many thousands of thoughtful
men in all ages, and many thousands still, would say, that the glen
can only be a few thousand, or possibly a few hundred, years old.&nbsp;
And he will feel bound to consider their opinion; as far as it is, like
his own, drawn from facts, but no further.</p>
<p>So he casts about for all other methods by which the glen may have
been produced, to see if any one of them will account for it in a shorter
time.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Was it made by an earthquake?&nbsp; No; for the strata on
both sides are identical, at the same level, and in the same plane.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Or by a mighty current?&nbsp; If so, the flood must have
run in at the upper end, before it ran out at the lower.&nbsp; But nothing
has run in at the upper end.&nbsp; All round above are the undisturbed
gravel beds of the horizontal moor, without channel or depression.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Or by water draining off a vast flat as it was upheaved
out of the sea?&nbsp; That is a likely guess.&nbsp; The valley at its
upper end spreads out like the fingers of a hand, as the gullies in
tide-muds do.</p>
<p>But that hypothesis will not stand.&nbsp; There is no vast unbroken
flat behind the glen.&nbsp; Right and left of it are other similar glens,
parted from it by long narrow ridges: these also must be explained on
the same hypothesis; but they cannot.&nbsp; For there could not have
been surface-drainage to make them all, or a tenth of them.&nbsp; There
are no other possible hypotheses; and so he must fall back on the original
theory&mdash;the rain, the springs, the brook; they have done it all,
even as they are doing it this day.</p>
<p>But is not that still a hasty assumption?&nbsp; May not their denuding
power have been far greater in old times than now?</p>
<p>Why should it?&nbsp; Because there was more rain then than now?&nbsp;
That he must put out of court; there is no evidence of it whatsoever.</p>
<p>Because the land was more friable originally?&nbsp; Well, there is
a great deal to be said for that.&nbsp; The experience of every countryman
tells him that bare or fallow land is more easily washed away than land
under vegetation.&nbsp; And no doubt, when these gravels and sands rose
from the sea, they were barren for hundreds of years.&nbsp; He has some
measure of the time required, because he can tell roughly how long it
takes for sands and shingles left by the sea to become covered with
vegetation.&nbsp; But he must allow that the friability of the land
must have been originally much greater than now, for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>But again, does that fact really cut off any great space of time
from his hundreds of thousands of years?&nbsp; For when the land first
rose from the sea, that glen was not there.&nbsp; Some slight bay or
bend in the shore determined its site.&nbsp; That stream was not there.&nbsp;
It was split up into a million little springs, oozing side by side from
the shore, and having each a very minute denuding power, which kept
continually increasing by combination as the glen ate its way inwards,
and the rainfall drained by all these little springs was collected into
the one central stream.&nbsp; So that when the ground being bare was
most liable to be denuded, the water was least able to do it; and as
the denuding power of the water increased, the land, being covered with
vegetation, became more and more able to resist it.&nbsp; All this he
has seen, going on at the present day, in the similar gullies worn in
the soft strata of the South Hampshire coast; especially round Bournemouth.</p>
<p>So the two disturbing elements in the calculation may be fairly set
off against each other, as making a difference of only a few thousands
or tens of thousands of years either way; and the age of the glen may
fairly be, if not a million years, yet such a length of years as mankind
still speak of with bated breath, as if forsooth it would do them some
harm.</p>
<p>I trust that every scientific man in this room will agree with me,
that the imaginary squire or ploughman would have been conducting his
investigation strictly according to the laws of the Baconian philosophy.&nbsp;
You will remark, meanwhile, that he has not used a single scientific
term, or referred to a single scientific investigation; and has observed
nothing and thought nothing which might not have been observed and thought
by any one who chose to use his common sense, and not to be afraid.</p>
<p>But because he has come round, after all this further investigation,
to something very like his first conclusion, was all that further investigation
useless?&nbsp; No&mdash;a thousand times, no.&nbsp; It is this very
verification of hypotheses which makes the sound ones safe, and destroys
the unsound.&nbsp; It is this struggle with all sorts of superstitions
which makes science strong and sure, and her march irresistible, winning
ground slowly, but never receding from it.&nbsp; It is this buffeting
of adversity which compels her not to rest dangerously upon the shallow
sand of first guesses, and single observations; but to strike her roots
down, deep, wide, and interlaced into the solid ground of actual facts.</p>
<p>It is very necessary to insist on this point.&nbsp; For there have
been men in all past ages&mdash;I do not say whether there are any such
now, but I am inclined to think that there will be hereafter&mdash;men
who have tried to represent scientific method as something difficult,
mysterious, peculiar, unique, not to be attained by the unscientific
mass; and this not for the purpose of exalting science, but rather of
discrediting her.&nbsp; For as long as the masses, educated or uneducated,
are ignorant of what scientific method is, they will look on scientific
men, as the middle age looked on necromancers, as a privileged, but
awful and uncanny caste, possessed of mighty secrets; who may do them
great good, but may also do them great harm.</p>
<p>Which belief on the part of the masses will enable these persons
to instal themselves as the critics of science, though not scientific
men themselves: and&mdash;as Shakespeare has it&mdash;to talk of Robin
Hood, though they never shot in his bow.&nbsp; Thus they become mediators
to the masses between the scientific and the unscientific worlds.&nbsp;
They tell them&mdash;You are not to trust the conclusions of men of
science at first hand.&nbsp; You are not fit judges of their facts or
of their methods.&nbsp; It is we who will, by a cautious eclecticism,
choose out for you such of their conclusions as are safe for you; and
them we will advise you to believe.&nbsp; To the scientific man, on
the other hand, as often as anything is discovered unpleasing to them,
they will say, imperiously and e cathedr&acirc;&mdash;Your new theory
contradicts the established facts of science.&nbsp; For they will know
well that whatever the men of science think of their assertion, the
masses will believe it; totally unaware that the speakers are by their
very terms showing their ignorance of science; and that what they call
established facts scientific men call merely provisional conclusions,
which they would throw away to-morrow without a pang were the known
facts explained better by a fresh theory, or did fresh facts require
one.</p>
<p>This has happened too often.&nbsp; It is in the interest of superstition
that it should happen again; and the best way to prevent it surely is
to tell the masses&mdash;Scientific method is no peculiar mystery, requiring
a peculiar initiation.&nbsp; It is simply common sense, combined with
uncommon courage, which includes uncommon honesty and uncommon patience;
and if you will be brave, honest, patient, and rational, you will need
no mystagogues to tell you what in science to believe and what not to
believe; for you will be just as good judges of scientific facts and
theories as those who assume the right of guiding your convictions.&nbsp;
You are men and women: and more than that you need not be.</p>
<p>And let me say that the man of our days whose writings exemplify
most thoroughly what I am going to say is the justly revered Mr. Thomas
Carlyle.</p>
<p>As far as I know he has never written on any scientific subject.&nbsp;
For aught I am aware of, he may know nothing of mathematics or chemistry,
of comparative anatomy or geology.&nbsp; For aught I am aware of, he
may know a great deal about them all, and, like a wise man, hold his
tongue, and give the world merely the results in the form of general
thought.&nbsp; But this I know; that his writings are instinct with
the very spirit of science; that he has taught men, more than any living
man, the meaning and end of science; that he has taught men moral and
intellectual courage; to face facts boldly, while they confess the divineness
of facts; not to be afraid of Nature, and not to worship nature; to
believe that man can know truth; and that only in as far as he knows
truth can he live worthily on this earth.&nbsp; And thus he has vindicated,
as no other man in our days has done, at once the dignity of Nature
and the dignity of spirit.&nbsp; That he would have made a distinguished
scientific man, we may be as certain from his writings as we may be
certain, when we see a fine old horse of a certain stamp, that he would
have made a first-class hunter, though he has been unfortunately all
his life in harness.&nbsp; Therefore, did I try to train a young man
of science to be true, devout, and earnest, accurate and daring, I should
say&mdash;Read what you will: but at least read Carlyle.&nbsp; It is
a small matter to me&mdash;and I doubt not to him&mdash;whether you
will agree with his special conclusions: but his premises and his method
are irrefragable; for they stand on the &ldquo;voluntatem Dei in rebus
revelatam&rdquo;&mdash;on fact and common sense.</p>
<p>And Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s writings, if I am correct in my estimate
of them, will afford a very sufficient answer to those who think that
the scientific habit of mind tends to irreverence.</p>
<p>Doubtless this accusation will always be brought against science
by those who confound reverence with fear.&nbsp; For from blind fear
of the unknown, science does certainly deliver man.&nbsp; She does by
man as he does by an unbroken colt.&nbsp; The colt sees by the road
side some quite new object&mdash;a cast-away boot, an old kettle, or
what not.&nbsp; What a fearful monster!&nbsp; What unknown terrific
powers may it not possess!&nbsp; And the colt shies across the road,
runs up the bank, rears on end; putting itself thereby, as many a man
does, in real danger.&nbsp; What cure is there?&nbsp; But one; experience.&nbsp;
So science takes us, as we should take the colt, gently by the halter;
and makes us simply smell at the new monster; till after a few trembling
sniffs, we discover, like the colt, that it is not a monster, but a
kettle.&nbsp; Yet I think, if we sum up the loss and gain, we shall
find the colt&rsquo;s character has gained, rather than lost, by being
thus disabused.&nbsp; He learns to substitute a very rational reverence
for the man who is breaking him in, for a totally irrational reverence
for the kettle; and becomes thereby a much wiser and more useful member
of society, as does the man when disabused of his superstitions.</p>
<p>From which follows one result.&nbsp; That if science proposes&mdash;as
she does&mdash;to make men brave, wise, and independent, she must needs
excite unpleasant feelings in all who desire to keep men cowardly, ignorant,
and slavish.&nbsp; And that too many such persons have existed in all
ages is but too notorious.&nbsp; There have been from all time, go&euml;tai,
quacks, powwow men, rain-makers, and necromancers of various sorts,
who having for their own purposes set forth partial, ill-grounded, fantastic,
and frightful interpretations of nature, have no love for those who
search after a true, exact, brave, and hopeful one.&nbsp; And therefore
it is to be feared, or hoped, science and superstition will to the world&rsquo;s
end remain irreconcilable and internecine foes.</p>
<p>Conceive the feelings of an old Lapland witch, who has had for the
last fifty years all the winds in a sealskin bag, and has been selling
fair breezes to northern skippers at so much a puff, asserting her powers
so often, poor old soul, that she has got to half believe them herself,&mdash;conceive,
I say, her feelings at seeing her customers watch the Admiralty storm-signals,
and con the weather reports in the &lsquo;Times.&rsquo;&nbsp; Conceive
the feelings of Sir Samuel Baker&rsquo;s African friend, Katchiba, the
rain-making chief, who possessed a whole housefull of thunder and lightning&mdash;though
he did not, he confessed, keep it in a bottle as they do in England&mdash;if
Sir Samuel had had the means, and the will, of giving to Katchiba&rsquo;s
Negros a course of lectures on electricity, with appropriate experiments,
and a real bottle full of real lightning among the foremost.</p>
<p>It is clear that only two methods of self-defence would have been
open to the rain-maker: namely, either to kill Sir Samuel, or to buy
his real secret of bottling the lightning, that he might use it for
his own ends.&nbsp; The former method&mdash;that of killing the man
of science&mdash;was found more easy in ancient times; the latter in
these modern ones.&nbsp; And there have been always those who, too good-natured
to kill the scientific man, have patronised knowledge, not for its own
sake, but for the use which may be made of it; who would like to keep
a tame man of science, as they would a tame poet, or a tame parrot;
who say&mdash;Let us have science by all means, but not too much of
it.&nbsp; It is a dangerous thing; to be doled out to the world, like
medicine, in small and cautious doses.&nbsp; You, the scientific man,
will of course freely discover what you choose.&nbsp; Only do not talk
too loudly about it: leave that to us.&nbsp; We understand the world,
and are meant to guide and govern it.&nbsp; So discover freely: and
meanwhile hand over your discoveries to us, that we may instruct and
edify the populace with so much of them as we think safe, while we keep
our position thereby, and in many cases make much money by your science.&nbsp;
Do that, and we will patronise you, applaud you, ask you to our houses;
and you shall be clothed in purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously
with us every day.&nbsp; I know not whether these latter are not the
worst enemies which science has.&nbsp; They are often such excellent,
respectable, orderly, well-meaning persons.&nbsp; They desire so sincerely
that everyone should be wise: only not too wise.&nbsp; They are so utterly
unaware of the mischief they are doing.&nbsp; They would recoil with
horror if they were told they were so many Iscariots, betraying Truth
with a kiss.</p>
<p>But science, as yet, has withstood both terrors and blandishments.&nbsp;
In old times, she endured being imprisoned and slain.&nbsp; She came
to life again.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the will of Him in whom all things
live, that she should live.&nbsp; Perhaps it was His spirit which gave
her life.</p>
<p>She can endure, too, being starved.&nbsp; Her votaries have not as
yet cared much for purple and fine linen, and sumptuous fare.&nbsp;
There are a very few among them who, joining brilliant talents to solid
learning, have risen to deserved popularity, to titles, and to wealth.&nbsp;
But even their labours, it seems to me, are never rewarded in any proportion
to the time and the intellect spent on them, nor to the benefits which
they bring to mankind; while the great majority, unpaid and unknown,
toil on, and have to find in science her own reward.&nbsp; Better, perhaps,
that it should be so.&nbsp; Better for science that she should be free,
in holy poverty, to go where she will and say what she knows, than that
she should be hired out at so much a year to say things pleasing to
the many, and to those who guide the many.&nbsp; And so, I verily believe,
the majority of scientific men think.&nbsp; There are those among them
who have obeyed very faithfully St. Paul&rsquo;s precept, &ldquo;No
man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For they have discovered that they are engaged in a war&mdash;a veritable
war&mdash;against the rulers of darkness, against ignorance and its
twin children, fear and cruelty.&nbsp; Of that war they see neither
the end nor even the plan.&nbsp; But they are ready to go on; ready,
with Socrates, &ldquo;to follow reason withersoever it leads;&rdquo;
and content, meanwhile, like good soldiers in a campaign, if they can
keep tolerably in line, and use their weapons, and see a few yards ahead
of them through the smoke and the woods.&nbsp; They will come out somewhere
at last; they know not where nor when: but they will come out at last,
into the daylight and the open field; and be told then&mdash;perhaps
to their own astonishment&mdash;as many a gallant soldier has been told,
that by simply walking straight on, and doing the duty which lay nearest
them, they have helped to win a great battle, and slay great giants,
earning the thanks of their country and of mankind.</p>
<p>And, meanwhile, if they get their shilling a day of fighting-pay,
they are content.&nbsp; I had almost said, they ought to be content.&nbsp;
For science is, I verily believe, like virtue, its own exceeding great
reward.&nbsp; I can conceive few human states more enviable than that
of the man to whom, panting in the foul laboratory, or watching for
his life under the tropic forest, Isis shall for a moment lift her sacred
veil, and show him, once and for ever, the thing he dreamed not of;
some law, or even mere hint of a law, explaining one fact; but explaining
with it a thousand more, connecting them all with each other and with
the mighty whole, till order and meaning shoots through some old Chaos
of scattered observations.</p>
<p>Is not that a joy, a prize, which wealth cannot give, nor poverty
take away?&nbsp; What it may lead to, he knows not.&nbsp; Of what use
it may become, he knows not.&nbsp; But this he knows, that somewhere
it must lead; of some use it will be.&nbsp; For it is a truth; and having
found a truth, he has exorcised one more of the ghosts which haunt humanity.&nbsp;
He has left one object less for man to fear; one object more for man
to use.&nbsp; Yes, the scientific man may have this comfort, that whatever
he has done, he has done good; that he is following a mistress who has
never yet conferred aught but benefits on the human race.</p>
<p>What physical science may do hereafter I know not; but as yet she
has done this:</p>
<p>She has enormously increased the wealth of the human race; and has
therefore given employment, food, existence, to millions who, without
science, would either have starved or have never been born.&nbsp; She
has shown that the dictum of the early political economists, that population
has a tendency to increase faster than the means of subsistence, is
no law of humanity, but merely a tendency of the barbaric and ignorant
man, which can be counteracted by increasing manifold by scientific
means his powers of producing food.&nbsp; She has taught men, during
the last few years, to foresee and elude the most destructive storms;
and there is no reason for doubting, and many reasons for hoping, that
she will gradually teach men to elude other terrific forces of nature,
too powerful and too seemingly capricious for them to conquer.&nbsp;
She has discovered innumerable remedies and alleviations for pains and
disease.&nbsp; She has thrown such light on the causes of epidemics,
that we are able to say now that the presence of cholera&mdash;and probably
of all zymotic diseases&mdash;in any place, is usually a sin and a shame,
for which the owners and authorities of that place ought to be punishable
by law, as destroyers of their fellow-men; while for the weak, for those
who, in the barbarous and semi-barbarous state&mdash;and out of that
last we are only just emerging&mdash;how much has she done; an earnest
of much more which she will do?&nbsp; She has delivered the insane&mdash;I
may say by the scientific insight of one man, more worthy of titles
and pensions than nine-tenths of those who earn them&mdash;I mean the
great and good Pinel&mdash;from hopeless misery and torture into comparative
peace and comfort, and at least the possibility of cure.&nbsp; For children,
she has done much, or rather might do, would parents read and perpend
such books as Andrew Combe&rsquo;s and those of other writers on physical
education.&nbsp; We should not then see the children, even of the rich,
done to death piecemeal by improper food, improper clothes, neglect
of ventilation and the commonest measures for preserving health.&nbsp;
We should not see their intellects stunted by Procrustean attempts to
teach them all the same accomplishments, to the neglect, most often,
of any sound practical training of their faculties.&nbsp; We should
not see slight indigestion, or temporary rushes of blood to the head,
condemned and punished as sins against Him who took up little children
in His arms and blessed them.</p>
<p>But we may have hope.&nbsp; When we compare education now with what
it was even forty years ago, much more with the stupid brutality of
the monastic system, we may hail for children, as well as for grown
people, the advent of the reign of common sense.</p>
<p>And for woman&mdash;What might I not say on that point?&nbsp; But
most of it would be fitly discussed only among physicians and biologists:
here I will say only this&mdash;Science has exterminated, at least among
civilised nations, witch-manias.&nbsp; Women&mdash;at least white women&mdash;are
no longer tortured or burnt alive from man&rsquo;s blind fear of the
unknown.&nbsp; If science had done no more than that, she would deserve
the perpetual thanks and the perpetual trust, not only of the women
whom she has preserved from agony, but the men whom she has preserved
from crime.</p>
<p>These benefits have already accrued to civilised men, because they
have lately allowed a very few of their number peaceably to imitate
Mr. Rarey, and find out what nature&mdash;or rather, to speak at once
reverently and accurately, He who made nature&mdash;is thinking of;
and obey the &ldquo;voluntatem Dei in rebus revelatam.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This science has done, while yet in her infancy.&nbsp; What she will
do in her maturity, who dare predict?&nbsp; At least, in the face of
such facts as these, those who bid us fear, or restrain, or mutilate
science, bid us commit an act of folly, as well as of ingratitude, which
can only harm ourselves.&nbsp; For science has as yet done nothing but
good.&nbsp; Will any one tell me what harm it has ever done?&nbsp; When
any one will show me a single result of science, of the knowledge of
and use of physical facts, which has not tended directly to the benefit
of mankind, moral and spiritual, as well as physical and economic&mdash;then
I shall be tempted to believe that Solomon was wrong when he said that
the one thing to be sought after on earth, more precious than all treasure,
she who has length of days in her right hand, and in her left hand riches
and honour, whose ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are
peace, who is a tree of life to all who lay hold on her, and makes happy
every one who retains her, is&mdash;as you will see if you will yourselves
consult the passage&mdash;that very Wisdom&mdash;by which God has founded
the earth; and that very Understanding&mdash;by which He has established
the heavens.</p>
<h2>GROTS AND GROVES</h2>
<p>I wish this lecture to be suggestive, rather that didactic; to set
you thinking and inquiring for yourselves, rather than learning at second-hand
from me.&nbsp; Some among my audience, I doubt not, will neither need
to be taught by me, nor to be stirred up to inquiry for themselves.&nbsp;
They are already, probably, antiquarians; already better acquainted
with the subject than I am.&nbsp; They come hither, therefore, as critics;
I trust not as unkindly critics.&nbsp; They will, I hope, remember that
I am trying to excite a general interest in that very architecture in
which they delight, and so to make the public do justice to their labours.&nbsp;
They will therefore, I trust,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be to my faults a little blind,<br />
Be to my virtues very kind;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and if my architectural theories do not seem to them correct in all
details&mdash;well-founded I believe them myself to be&mdash;remember
that it is a slight matter to me, or to the audience, whether any special
and pet fancy of mine should be exactly true or not: but it is not a
light matter that my hearers should be awakened&mdash;and too many just
now need an actual awakening&mdash;to a right, pure, and wholesome judgment
on questions of art, especially when the soundness of that judgment
depends, as in this case, on sound judgments about human history, as
well as about natural objects.</p>
<p>Now, it befel me that, fresh from the Tropic forests, and with their
forms hanging always, as it were, in the background of my eye, I was
impressed more and more vividly the longer I looked, with the likeness
of those forest forms to the forms of our own Cathedral of Chester.&nbsp;
The grand and graceful Chapter-house transformed itself into one of
those green bowers, which, once seen, and never to be seen again, make
one at once richer and poorer for the rest of life.&nbsp; The fans of
groining sprang from the short columns, just as do the feathered boughs
of the far more beautiful Maximiliana palm, and just of the same size
and shape: and met overhead, as I have seen them meet, in aisles longer
by far than our cathedral nave.&nbsp; The free upright shafts, which
give such strength, and yet such lightness, to the mullions of each
window, pierced upward through those curving lines, as do the stems
of young trees through the fronds of palm; and, like them, carried the
eye and the fancy up into the infinite, and took off a sense of oppression
and captivity which the weight of the roof might have produced.&nbsp;
In the nave, in the choir the same vision of the Tropic forest haunted
me.&nbsp; The fluted columns not only resembled, but seemed copied from
the fluted stems beneath which I had ridden in the primeval woods; their
bases, their capitals, seemed copied from the bulgings at the collar
of the root, and at the spring of the boughs, produced by a check of
the redundant sap; and were garlanded often enough like the capitals
of the columns, with delicate tracery of parasite leaves and flowers;
the mouldings of the arches seemed copied from the parallel bundles
of the curving bamboo shoots; and even the flatter roof of the nave
and transepts had its antitype in that highest level of the forest aisles,
where the trees, having climbed at last to the light-food which they
seek, care no longer to grow upward, but spread out in huge limbs, almost
horizontal, reminding the eye of the four-centred arch which marks the
period of Perpendicular Gothic.</p>
<p>Nay, to this day there is one point in our cathedral which, to me,
keeps up the illusion still.&nbsp; As I enter the choir, and look upward
toward the left, I cannot help seeing, in the tabernacle work of the
stalls, the slender and aspiring forms of the &ldquo;rastrajo;&rdquo;
the delicate second growth which, as it were, rushes upward from the
earth wherever the forest is cleared; and above it, in the tall lines
of the north-west pier of the tower&mdash;even though defaced, along
the inner face of the western arch, by ugly and needless perpendicular
panelling&mdash;I seem to see the stems of huge Cedars, or Balatas,
or Ceibas, curving over, as they would do, into the great beams of the
transept roof, some seventy feet above the ground.</p>
<p>Nay, so far will the fancy lead, that I have seemed to see, in the
stained glass between the tracery of the windows, such gorgeous sheets
of colour as sometimes flash on the eye, when, far aloft, between high
stems and boughs, you catch sight of some great tree ablaze with flowers,
either its own or those of a parasite; yellow or crimson, white or purple;
and over them again the cloudless blue.</p>
<p>Now, I know well that all these dreams are dreams; that the men who
built our northern cathedrals never saw these forest forms; and that
the likeness of their work to those of Tropic nature is at most only
a corroboration of Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s dictum, that &ldquo;the Gothic
did not arise out of, but developed itself into, a resemblance to vegetation.
. . .&nbsp; It was no chance suggestion of the form of an arch from
the bending of a bough, but the gradual and continual discovery of a
beauty in natural forms which could be more and more transferred into
those of stone, which influenced at once the hearts of the people and
the form of the edifice.&rdquo;&nbsp; So true is this, that by a pure
and noble copying of the vegetable beauty which they had seen in their
own clime, the medieval craftsmen went so far&mdash;as I have shown
you&mdash;as to anticipate forms of vegetable beauty peculiar to Tropic
climes, which they had not seen: a fresh proof, if proof were needed,
that beauty is something absolute and independent of man; and not, as
some think, only relative, and what happens to be pleasant to the eye
of this man or that.</p>
<p>But thinking over this matter, and reading over, too, that which
Mr. Ruskin has written thereon in his &lsquo;Stones of Venice,&rsquo;
vol. ii. cap. vi., on the nature of Gothic, I came to certain further
conclusions&mdash;or at least surmises&mdash;which I put before you
to-night, in hopes that if they have no other effect on you, they will
at least stir some of you up to read Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Ruskin says, &ldquo;That the original conception of Gothic
architecture has been derived from vegetation, from the symmetry of
avenues and the interlacing of branches, is a strange and vain supposition.&nbsp;
It is a theory which never could have existed for a moment in the mind
of any person acquainted with early Gothic: but, however idle as a theory,
it is most valuable as a testimony to the character of the perfected
style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless so.&nbsp; But you must remember always that the subject
of my lecture is Grots and Groves; that I am speaking not of Gothic
architecture in general, but of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture;
and more, almost exclusively of the ecclesiastical architecture of the
Teutonic or northern nations; because in them, as I think, the resemblance
between the temple and the forest reached the fullest exactness.</p>
<p>Now the original idea of a Christian church was that of a grot; a
cave.&nbsp; That is a historic fact.&nbsp; The Christianity which was
passed on to us began to worship, hidden and persecuted, in the catacombs
of Rome, it may be often around the martyrs&rsquo; tombs, by the dim
light of candle or of torch.&nbsp; The candles on the Roman altars,
whatever they have been made to symbolise since then, are the hereditary
memorials of that fact.&nbsp; Throughout the North, in these isles as
much as in any land, the idea of the grot was, in like wise, the idea
of a church.&nbsp; The saint or hermit built himself a cell; dark, massive,
intended to exclude light as well as weather; or took refuge in a cave.&nbsp;
There he prayed and worshipped, and gathered others to pray and worship
round him, during his life.&nbsp; There he, often enough, became an
object of worship, in his turn, after his death.&nbsp; In after ages
his cave was ornamented, like that of the hermit of Montmajour by Arles;
or his cell-chapel enlarged, as those of the Scotch and Irish saints
have been, again and again; till at last a stately minster rose above
it.&nbsp; Still, the idea that the church was to be a grot haunted the
minds of builders.</p>
<p>But side by side with the Christian grot there was throughout the
North another form of temple, dedicated to very different gods; namely,
the trees from whose mighty stems hung the heads of the victims of Odin
or of Thor, the horse, the goat, and in time of calamity or pestilence,
of men.&nbsp; Trees and not grots were the temples of our forefathers.</p>
<p>Scholars know well&mdash;but they must excuse my quoting it for the
sake of those who are not scholars&mdash;the famous passage of Tacitus
which tells how our forefathers &ldquo;held it beneath the dignity of
the gods to coop them within walls, or liken them to any human countenance:
but consecrated groves and woods, and called by the name of gods that
mystery which they held by faith alone;&rdquo; and the equally famous
passage of Claudian, about &ldquo;the vast silence of the Black Forest,
and groves awful with ancient superstition; and oaks, barbarian deities;&rdquo;
and Lucan&rsquo;s &ldquo;groves inviolate from all antiquity, and altars
stained with human blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To worship in such spots was an abomination to the early Christian.&nbsp;
It was as much a test of heathendom as the eating of horse-flesh, sacred
to Odin, and therefore unclean to Christian men.&nbsp; The Lombard laws
and others forbid expressly the lingering remnants of grove worship.&nbsp;
St. Boniface and other early missionaries hewed down in defiance the
sacred oaks, and paid sometimes for their valour with their lives.</p>
<p>It is no wonder, then, if long centuries elapsed ere the likeness
of vegetable forms began to reappear in the Christian churches of the
North.&nbsp; And yet both grot and grove were equally the natural temples
which the religious instinct of all deep-hearted peoples, conscious
of sin, and conscious, too, of yearnings after a perfection not to be
found on earth, chooses from the earliest stage of awakening civilisation.&nbsp;
In them, alone, before he had strength and skill to build nobly for
himself, could man find darkness, the mother of mystery and awe, in
which he is reminded perforce of his own ignorance and weakness; in
which he learns first to remember unseen powers, sometimes to his comfort
and elevation, sometimes only to his terror and debasement; darkness;
and with it silence and solitude, in which he can collect himself, and
shut out the noise and glare, the meanness and the coarseness, of the
world; and be alone a while with his own thoughts, his own fancy, his
own conscience, his own soul.</p>
<p>But for a while, as I have said, that darkness, solitude, and silence
were to be sought in the grot, not in the grove.</p>
<p>Then Christianity conquered the Empire.&nbsp; It adapted, not merely
its architecture, but its very buildings, to its worship.&nbsp; The
Roman Basilica became the Christian church; a noble form of building
enough, though one in which was neither darkness, solitude, nor silence,
but crowded congregations, clapping&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;the popular
preacher; or fighting about the election of a bishop or a pope, till
the holy place ran with Christian blood.&nbsp; The deep-hearted Northern
turned away, in weariness and disgust, from those vast halls, fitted
only for the feverish superstition of a profligate and worn-out civilisation;
and took himself, amid his own rocks and forests, moors and shores,
to a simpler and sterner architecture, which should express a creed,
sterner; and at heart far simpler; though dogmatically the same.</p>
<p>And this is, to my mind, the difference, and the noble difference,
between the so-called Norman architecture, which came hither about the
time of the Conquest; and that of Romanized Italy.</p>
<p>But the Normans were a conquering race; and one which conquered,
be it always remembered, in England at least, in the name and by the
authority of Rome.&nbsp; Their ecclesiastics, like the ecclesiastics
on the Continent, were the representatives of Roman civilisation, of
Rome&rsquo;s right, intellectual and spiritual, to rule the world.</p>
<p>Therefore their architecture, like their creed, was Roman.&nbsp;
They took the massive towering Roman forms, which expressed domination;
and piled them one on the other, to express the domination of Christian
Rome over the souls, as they had represented the domination of heathen
Rome over the bodies, of men.&nbsp; And so side by side with the towers
of the Norman keep rose the towers of the Norman cathedral&mdash;the
two signs of a double servitude.</p>
<p>But, with the thirteenth century, there dawned an age in Northern
Europe, which I may boldly call an heroic age; heroic in its virtues
and in its crimes; an age of rich passionate youth, or rather of early
manhood; full of aspirations, of chivalry, of self-sacrifice as strange
and terrible as it was beautiful and noble, even when most misguided.&nbsp;
The Teutonic nations of Europe&mdash;our own forefathers most of all&mdash;having
absorbed all that heathen Rome could teach them, at least for the time
being, began to think for themselves; to have poets, philosophers, historians,
architects, of their own.&nbsp; The thirteenth century was especially
an age of aspiration; and its architects expressed, in buildings quite
unlike those of the preceding centuries, the aspirations of the time.</p>
<p>The Pointed Arch had been introduced half a century before.&nbsp;
It may be that the Crusaders saw it in the East and brought it home.&nbsp;
It may be that it originated from the quadripartite vaulting of the
Normans, the segmental groins of which, crossing diagonally, produced
to appearance the pointed arch.&nbsp; It may be that it was derived
from that mystical figure of a pointed oval form, the vesica piscis.&nbsp;
It may be, lastly, that it was suggested simply by the intersection
of semicircular arches, so frequently found in ornamental arcades.&nbsp;
The last cause may perhaps be the true one: but it matters little whence
the pointed arch came.&nbsp; It matters much what it meant to those
who introduced it.&nbsp; And at the beginning of the Transition or semi-Norman
period, it seems to have meant nothing.&nbsp; It was not till the thirteenth
century that it had gradually received, as it were, a soul, and had
become the exponent of a great idea.&nbsp; As the Norman architecture
and its forms had signified domination, so the Early English, as we
call it, signified aspiration; an idea which was perfected, as far as
it could be, in what we call the Decorated style.</p>
<p>There is an evident gap, I had almost said a gulf, between the architectural
mind of the eleventh and that of the thirteenth century.&nbsp; A vertical
tendency, a longing after lightness and freedom, appears; and with them
a longing to reproduce the graces of nature and art.&nbsp; And here
I ask you to look for yourselves at the buildings of this new era&mdash;there
is a beautiful specimen in yonder arcade <a name="citation304"></a><a href="#footnote304">{304}</a>&mdash;and
judge for yourselves whether they, and even more than they the Decorated
style into which they developed, do not remind you of the forest shapes?</p>
<p>And if they remind you: must they not have reminded those who shaped
them?&nbsp; Can it have been otherwise?&nbsp; We know that the men who
built were earnest.&nbsp; The carefulness, the reverence, of their work
have given a subject for some of Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s noblest chapters,
a text for some of his noblest sermons.&nbsp; We know that they were
students of vegetable form.&nbsp; That is proved by the flowers, the
leaves, even the birds, with which they enwreathed their capitals and
enriched their mouldings.&nbsp; Look up there, and see.</p>
<p>You cannot look at any good church-work from the thirteenth to the
middle of the fifteenth century, without seeing that leaves and flowers
were perpetually in the workman&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Do you fancy that
stems and boughs were never in his mind?&nbsp; He kept, doubtless, in
remembrance the fundamental idea, that the Christian church should symbolise
a grot or cave.&nbsp; He could do no less; while he again and again
saw hermits around him dwelling and worshipping in caves, as they had
done ages before in Egypt and Syria; while he fixed, again and again,
the site of his convent and his minster in some secluded valley guarded
by cliffs and rocks, like Vale Crucis in North Wales.&nbsp; But his
minster stood often not among rocks only, but amid trees; in some clearing
in the primeval forest, as Vale Crucis was then.&nbsp; At least he could
not pass from minster to minster, from town to town, without journeying
through long miles of forest.&nbsp; Do you think that the awful shapes
and shadows of that forest never haunted his imagination as he built?&nbsp;
He would have cut down ruthlessly, as his predecessors the early missionaries
did, the sacred trees amid which Thor and Odin had been worshipped by
the heathen Saxons; amid which still darker deities were still worshipped
by the heathen tribes of Eastern Europe.&nbsp; But he was the descendant
of men who had worshipped in those groves; and the glamour of them was
upon him still.&nbsp; He peopled the wild forest with demons and fairies:
but that did not surely prevent his feeling its ennobling grandeur,
its chastening loneliness.&nbsp; His ancestors had held the oaks for
trees of God, even as the Jews held the Cedar, and the Hindoos likewise;
for the Deodara pine is not only, botanists tell us, the same as the
Cedar of Lebanon: but its very name&mdash;the Deodara&mdash;signifies
nought else but &ldquo;The tree of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His ancestors, I say, had held the oaks for trees of God.&nbsp; It
may be that as the monk sat beneath their shade with his Bible on his
knee, like good St. Boniface in the Fulda forest, he found that his
ancestors were right.</p>
<p>To understand what sort of trees they were from which he got his
inspiration: you must look, not at an average English wood, perpetually
thinned out as the trees arrive at middle age.&nbsp; Still less must
you look at the pines, oaks, beeches, of an English park, where each
tree has had space to develop itself freely into a more or less rounded
form.&nbsp; You must not even look at the tropic forests.&nbsp; For
there, from the immense diversity of forms, twenty varieties of tree
will grow beneath each other, forming a close-packed heap of boughs
and leaves, from the ground to a hundred feet and more aloft.</p>
<p>You should look at the North American forests of social trees&mdash;especially
of pines and firs, where trees of one species, crowded together, and
competing with equal advantages for the air and light, form themselves
into one wilderness of straight smooth shafts, surmounted by a flat
sheet of foliage, held up by boughs like the ribs of a groined roof;
while underneath the ground is bare as a cathedral floor.</p>
<p>You all know, surely, the Hemlock spruce of America; which, while
growing by itself in open ground, is the most wilful and fantastic,
as well as the most graceful, of all the firs; imitating the shape,
not of its kindred, but of an enormous tuft of fern.</p>
<p>Yet if you look at the same tree, when it has struggled long for
life from its youth amid other trees of its own kind and its own age;
you find that the lower boughs have died off from want of light, leaving
not a scar behind.&nbsp; The upper boughs have reached at once the light,
and their natural term of years.&nbsp; They are content to live, and
little more.&nbsp; The central trunk no longer sends up each year a
fresh perpendicular shoot to aspire above the rest: but as weary of
struggling ambition as they are, is content to become more and more
their equal as the years pass by.&nbsp; And this is a law of social
forest trees, which you must bear in mind, whenever I speak of the influence
of tree-forms on Gothic architecture.</p>
<p>Such forms as these are rare enough in Europe now.&nbsp; I never
understood how possible, how common, they must have been in medieval
Europe, till I saw in the forest of Fontainebleau a few oaks like the
oak of Charlemagne, and the Bouquet du Roi, at whose age I dare not
guess, but whose size and shape showed them to have once formed part
of a continuous wood, the like whereof remains not in these isles&mdash;perhaps
not east of the Carpathian Mountains.&nbsp; In them a clear shaft of
at least sixty, it may be eighty feet, carries a flat head of boughs,
each in itself a tree.&nbsp; In such a grove, I thought, the heathen
Gaul, even the heathen Frank, worshipped, beneath &ldquo;trees of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such trees, I thought, centuries after, inspired the genius of every
builder of Gothic aisles and roofs.</p>
<p>Thus, at least, we can explain that rigidity, which Mr. Ruskin tells
us, &ldquo;is a special element of Gothic architecture.&nbsp; Greek
and Egyptian buildings,&rdquo; he says&mdash;and I should have added,
Roman buildings also, in proportion to their age, <i>i.e</i>., to the
amount of the Roman elements in them&mdash;&ldquo;stand for the most
part, by their own weight and mass, one stone passively incumbent on
another: but in the Gothic vaults and traceries there is a stiffness
analogous to that of the bones of a limb, or fibres of a tree; an elastic
tension and communication of force from part to part; and also a studious
expression of this throughout every part of the building.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In a word, Gothic vaulting and tracery have been studiously made like
to boughs of trees.&nbsp; Were those boughs present to the mind of the
architect?&nbsp; Or is the coincidence merely fortuitous?&nbsp; You
know already how I should answer.&nbsp; The cusped arch, too, was it
actually not intended to imitate vegetation?&nbsp; Mr. Ruskin seems
to think so.&nbsp; He says that it is merely the special application
to the arch of the great ornamental system of foliation, which, &ldquo;whether
simple as in the cusped arch, or complicated as in tracery, arose out
of the love of leafage.&nbsp; Not that the form of the arch is intended
to imitate a leaf, but to be invested with the same characters of beauty
which the designer had discovered in the leaf.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now I differ
from Mr. Ruskin with extreme hesitation.&nbsp; I agree that the cusped
arch is not meant to imitate a leaf.&nbsp; I think with Mr. Ruskin,
that it was probably first adopted on account of its superior strength;
and that it afterwards took the form of a bough.&nbsp; But I cannot
as yet believe that it was not at last intended to imitate a bough;
a bough of a very common form, and one in which &ldquo;active rigidity&rdquo;
is peculiarly shown.&nbsp; I mean a bough which has forked.&nbsp; If
the lower fork has died off, for want of light, we obtain something
like the simply cusped arch.&nbsp; If it be still living&mdash;but short
and stunted in comparison with the higher fork&mdash;we obtain, it seems
to me, something like the foliated cusp; both likenesses being near
enough to those of common objects to make it possible that those objects
may have suggested them.&nbsp; And thus, more and more boldly, the medi&aelig;val
architect learnt to copy boughs, stems, and, at last, the whole effect,
as far always as stone would allow, of a combination of rock and tree,
of grot and grove.</p>
<p>So he formed his minsters, as I believe, upon the model of those
leafy minsters in which he walked to meditate, amid the aisles which
God, not man, has built.&nbsp; He sent their columns aloft like the
boles of ancient trees.&nbsp; He wreathed their capitals, sometimes
their very shafts, with flowers and creeping shoots.&nbsp; He threw
their arches out, and interwove the groinings of their vaults, like
the bough-roofage overhead.&nbsp; He decked with foliage and fruit the
bosses above and the corbels below.&nbsp; He sent up out of those corbels
upright shafts along the walls, in the likeness of the trees which sprang
out of the rocks above his head.&nbsp; He raised those walls into great
cliffs.&nbsp; He pierced them with the arches of the triforium, as with
hermits&rsquo; cells.&nbsp; He represented in the horizontal sills of
his windows, and in his horizontal string-courses, the horizontal strata
of the rocks.&nbsp; He opened the windows into high and lofty glades,
broken, as in the forest, by the tracery of stems and boughs, through
which was seen, not merely the outer, but the upper world.&nbsp; For
he craved, as all true artists crave, for light and colour; and had
the sky above been one perpetual blue, he might have been content with
it, and left his glass transparent.&nbsp; But in that dark dank northern
clime, rain and snowstorm, black cloud and grey mist, were all that
he was like to see outside for nine months in the year.&nbsp; So he
took such light and colour as nature gave in her few gayer moods; and
set aloft his stained glass windows the hues of the noonday and the
rainbow, and the sunrise and the sunset, and the purple of the heather,
and the gold of the gorse, and the azure of the bugloss, and the crimson
of the poppy; and among them, in gorgeous robes, the angels and the
saints of heaven, and the memories of heroic virtues and heroic sufferings,
that he might lift up his own eyes and heart for ever out of the dark,
dank, sad world of the cold north, with all its coarsenesses and its
crimes, toward a realm of perpetual holiness, amid a perpetual summer
of beauty and of light; as one who&mdash;for he was true to nature,
even in that&mdash;from between the black jaws of a narrow glen, or
from beneath the black shade of gnarled trees, catches a glimpse of
far lands gay with gardens and cottages, and purple mountain ranges,
and the far off sea, and the hazy horizon melting into the hazy sky;
and finds his heart carried out into an infinite at once of freedom
and of repose.</p>
<p>And so out of the cliffs and the forests he shaped the inside of
his church.&nbsp; And how did he shape the outside?&nbsp; Look for yourselves,
and judge.&nbsp; But look: not at Chester, but at Salisbury.&nbsp; Look
at those churches which carry not mere towers, but spires, or at least
pinnacled towers approaching the pyrmidal form.&nbsp; The outside form
of every Gothic cathedral must be considered imperfect if it does not
culminate in something pyramidal.</p>
<p>The especial want of all Greek and Roman buildings with which we
are acquainted is the absence&mdash;save in a few and unimportant cases&mdash;of
the pyramidal form.&nbsp; The Egyptians knew at least the worth of the
obelisk: but the Greeks and Romans hardly knew even that: their buildings
are flat-topped.&nbsp; Their builders were contented with the earth
as it was.&nbsp; There was a great truth involved in that; which I am
the last to deny.&nbsp; But religions which, like the Buddhist or the
Christian, nurse a noble self-discontent, are sure to adopt sooner or
later an upward and aspiring form of building.&nbsp; It is not merely
that, fancying heaven to be above earth, they point towards heaven.&nbsp;
There is a deeper natural language in the pyramidal form of a growing
tree.&nbsp; It symbolises growth, or the desire of growth.&nbsp; The
Norman tower does nothing of the kind.&nbsp; It does not aspire to grow.&nbsp;
Look&mdash;I mention an instance with which I am most familiar&mdash;at
the Norman tower of Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is graceful&mdash;awful,
if you will&mdash;but there is no aspiration in it.&nbsp; It is stately:
but self-content.&nbsp; Its horizontal courses; circular arches; above
all, its flat sky-line, seem to have risen enough: and wish to rise
no higher.&nbsp; For it has no touch of that unrest of soul, which is
expressed by the spire, and still more by the compound spire, with its
pinnacles, crockets, finials, which are finials only in name; for they
do not finish, and are really terminal buds, as it were, longing to
open and grow upward, even as the crockets are bracts and leaves thrown
off as the shoot has grown.</p>
<p>You feel, surely, the truth of these last words.&nbsp; You cannot
look at the canopy work or the pinnacle work of this cathedral without
seeing that they do not merely suggest buds and leaves, but that the
buds and leaves are there carven before your eyes.&nbsp; I myself cannot
look at the tabernacle work of our stalls without being reminded of
the young pine forests which clothe the Hampshire moors.&nbsp; But if
the details are copied from vegetable forms, why not the whole?&nbsp;
Is not a spire like a growing tree, a tabernacle like a fir-tree, a
compound spire like a group of firs?&nbsp; And if we can see that: do
you fancy that the man who planned the spire did not see it as clearly
as we do; and perhaps more clearly still?</p>
<p>I am aware, of course, that Norman architecture had sometimes its
pinnacle, a mere conical or polygonal capping.&nbsp; I am aware that
this form, only more and more slender, lasted on in England during the
thirteenth and the early part of the fourteenth century; and on the
Continent, under many modifications, one English kind whereof is usually
called a &ldquo;broach,&rdquo; of which you have a beautiful specimen
in the new church at Hoole.</p>
<p>Now, no one will deny that that broach is beautiful.&nbsp; But it
would be difficult to prove that its form was taken from a North European
tree.&nbsp; The cypress was unknown, probably, to our northern architects.&nbsp;
The Lombardy poplar&mdash;which has wandered hither, I know not when,
all the way from Cashmere&mdash;had not wandered then, I believe, further
than North Italy.&nbsp; The form is rather that of mere stone; of the
obelisk, or of the mountain peak; and they, in fact, may have at first
suggested the spire.&nbsp; The grandeur of an isolated mountain, even
of a dolmen or single upright stone, is evident to all.</p>
<p>But it is the grandeur, not of aspiration, but of defiance; not of
the Christian; not even of the Stoic: but rather of the Epicurean.&nbsp;
It says&mdash;I cannot rise.&nbsp; I do not care to rise.&nbsp; I will
be contentedly and valiantly that which I am; and face circumstances,
though I cannot conquer them.&nbsp; But it is defiance under defeat.&nbsp;
The mountain-peak does not grow, but only decays.&nbsp; Fretted by rains,
peeled by frost, splintered by lightning, it must down at last; and
crumble into earth, were it as old, as hard, as lofty as the Matterhorn
itself.&nbsp; And while it stands, it wants not only aspiration, it
wants tenderness; it wants humility; it wants the unrest which tenderness
and humility must breed, and which Mr. Ruskin so clearly recognises
in the best Gothic art.&nbsp; And, meanwhile, it wants naturalness.&nbsp;
The mere smooth spire or broach&mdash;I had almost said, even the spire
of Salisbury&mdash;is like no tall or commanding object in Nature.&nbsp;
It is merely the caricature of one; it may be of the mountain-peak.&nbsp;
The outline must be broken, must be softened, before it can express
the soul of a creed which, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
far more than now, was one of penitence as well as of aspiration, of
passionate emotion as well as of lofty faith.&nbsp; But a shape which
will express that soul must be sought, not among mineral, but among
vegetable, forms.&nbsp; And remember always, if we feel thus even now,
how much more must those medieval men of genius have felt thus, whose
work we now dare only copy line by line?</p>
<p>So&mdash;as it seems to me&mdash;they sought among vegetable forms
for what they needed: and they found it at once in the pine, or rather
the fir,&mdash;the spruce and silver firs of their own forests.&nbsp;
They are not, of course, indigenous to England.&nbsp; But they are so
common through all the rest of Europe, that not only would the form
suggest itself to a Continental architect, but to any English clerk
who travelled, as all did who could, across the Alps to Rome.&nbsp;
The fir-tree, not growing on level ground, like the oaks of Fontainebleau,
into one flat roof of foliage, but clinging to the hill-side and the
crag, old above young, spire above spire, whorl above whorl&mdash;for
the young shoots of each whorl of boughs point upward in the spring;
and now and then a whole bough, breaking away, as it were, into free
space, turns upward altogether, and forms a secondary spire on the same
tree&mdash;this surely was the form which the medi&aelig;val architect
seized, to clothe with it the sides and roof of the stone mountain which
he had built; piling up pinnacles and spires, each crocketed at the
angles; that, like a group of firs upon an isolated rock, every point
of the building might seem in act to grow toward heaven, till his idea
culminated in that glorious Minster of Cologne, which, if it ever be
completed, will be the likeness of one forest-clothed group of cliffs,
surmounted by three enormous pines.</p>
<p>One feature of the Norman temple he could keep; for it was copied
from the same nature which he was trying to copy&mdash;namely, the high-pitched
roof and gables.&nbsp; Mr. Ruskin lays it down as a law, that the acute
angle in roofs, gables, spires, is the distinguishing mark of northern
Gothic.&nbsp; It was adopted, most probably, at first from domestic
buildings.&nbsp; A northern house or barn must have a high-pitched roof:
or the snow will not slip off it.&nbsp; But that fact was not discovered
by man; it was copied by him from the rocks around.&nbsp; He saw the
mountain peak jut black and bare above the snows of winter; he saw those
snows slip down in sheets, rush down in torrents under the sun, from
the steep slabs of rock which coped the hill-side; and he copied, in
his roofs, the rocks above his town.&nbsp; But as the love for decoration
arose, he would deck his roofs as nature had decked hers, till the grey
sheets of the cathedral slates should stand out amid pinnacles and turrets
rich with foliage, as the grey mountain sides stood out amid knolls
of feathery birch and towering pine.</p>
<p>He failed, though he failed nobly.&nbsp; He never succeeded in attaining
a perfectly natural style.</p>
<p>The medieval architects were crippled to the last by the tradition
of artificial Roman forms.&nbsp; They began improving them into naturalness,
without any clear notion of what they wanted; and when that notion became
clear, it was too late.&nbsp; Take, as an instance, the tracery of their
windows.&nbsp; It is true, as Mr. Ruskin says, that they began by piercing
holes in a wall of the form of a leaf, which developed, in the rose
window, into the form of a star inside, and of a flower outside.&nbsp;
Look at such aloft there.&nbsp; Then, by introducing mullions and traceries
into the lower part of the window, they added stem and bough forms to
those flower forms.&nbsp; But the two did not fit.&nbsp; Look at the
west window of our choir, and you will see what I mean.&nbsp; The upright
mullions break off into bough curves graceful enough: but these are
cut short&mdash;as I hold, spoiled&mdash;by circular and triangular
forms of rose and trefoil resting on them as such forms never rest in
Nature; and the whole, though beautiful, is only half beautiful.&nbsp;
It is fragmentary, unmeaning, barbaric, because unnatural.</p>
<p>They failed, too, it may be, from the very paucity of the vegetable
forms they could find to copy among the flora of this colder clime;
and so, stopped short in drawing from nature, ran off into mere purposeless
luxuriance.&nbsp; Had they been able to add to their stock of memories
a hundred forms which they would have seen in the Tropics, they might
have gone on for centuries copying Nature without exhausting her.</p>
<p>And yet, did they exhaust even the few forms of beauty which they
saw around them?&nbsp; It must be confessed that they did not.&nbsp;
I believe that they could not, because they dared not.&nbsp; The unnaturalness
of the creed which they expressed always hampered them.&nbsp; It forbade
them to look Nature freely and lovingly in the face.&nbsp; It forbade
them&mdash;as one glaring example&mdash;to know anything truly of the
most beautiful of all natural objects&mdash;the human form.&nbsp; They
were tempted perpetually to take Nature as ornament, not as basis; and
they yielded at last to the temptation; till, in the age of Perpendicular
architecture, their very ornament became unnatural again; because conventional,
untrue, meaningless.</p>
<p>But the creed for which they worked was dying by that time, and therefore
the art which expressed it must needs die too.&nbsp; And even that death,
or rather the approach of it, was symbolised truly in the flatter roof,
the four-centred arch, the flat-topped tower of the fifteenth-century
church.&nbsp; The creed had ceased to aspire: so did the architecture.&nbsp;
It had ceased to grow: so did the temple.&nbsp; And the arch sank lower;
and the rafters grew more horizontal; and the likeness to the old tree,
content to grow no more, took the place of the likeness to the young
tree struggling toward the sky.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;unless you are tired of listening to me&mdash;a few
practical words.</p>
<p>We are restoring our old cathedral stone by stone after its ancient
model.&nbsp; We are also trying to build a new church.&nbsp; We are
building it&mdash;as most new churches in England are now built&mdash;in
a pure Gothic style.</p>
<p>Are we doing right?&nbsp; I do not mean morally right.&nbsp; It is
always morally right to build a new church, if needed, whatever be its
architecture.&nbsp; It is always morally right to restore an old church,
if it be beautiful and noble, as an heirloom handed down to us by our
ancestors, which we have no right&mdash;I say, no right&mdash;for the
sake of our children, and of our children&rsquo;s children, to leave
to ruin.</p>
<p>But are we artistically, &aelig;sthetically right?&nbsp; Is the best
Gothic fit for our worship?&nbsp; Does it express our belief?&nbsp;
Or shall we choose some other style?</p>
<p>I say that it is; and that it is so because it is a style which,
if not founded on Nature, has taken into itself more of Nature, of Nature
beautiful and healthy, than any other style.</p>
<p>With greater knowledge of Nature, both geographical and scientific,
fresh styles of architecture may and will arise, as much more beautiful,
and as much more natural, than the Gothic, as Gothic is more beautiful
and natural than the Norman.&nbsp; Till then we must take the best models
which we have; use them; and, as it were, use them up and exhaust them.&nbsp;
By that time we may have learnt to improve on them; and to build churches
more Gothic than Gothic itself, more like grot and grove than even a
northern cathedral.</p>
<p>That is the direction in which we must work.&nbsp; And if any shall
say to us, as it has been said ere now&mdash;&ldquo;After all, your
new Gothic churches are but imitations, shams, borrowed symbols, which
to you symbolise nothing.&nbsp; They are Romish churches, meant to express
Romish doctrine, built for a Protestant creed which they do not express,
and for a Protestant worship which they will not fit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
we shall answer&mdash;Not so.&nbsp; The objection might be true if we
built Norman or Romanesque churches; for we should then be returning
to that very foreign and unnatural style which Rome taught our forefathers,
and from which they escaped gradually into the comparative freedom,
the comparative naturalness of that true Gothic of which Mr. Ruskin
says so well:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is gladdening to remember that, in its utmost
nobleness, the very temper which has been thought most averse to it,
the Protestant temper of self-dependence and inquiry, were expressed
in every case.&nbsp; Faith and aspiration there were in every Christian
ecclesiastical building from the first century to the fifteenth: but
the moral habits to which England in this age owes the kind of greatness
which she has&mdash;the habits of philosophical investigation, of accurate
thought, of domestic seclusion and independence, of stern self-reliance,
and sincere upright searching into religious truth,&mdash;were only
traceable in the features which were the distinctive creations of the
Gothic schools, in the varied foliage and thorny fretwork, and shadowy
niche, and buttressed pier, and fearless height of subtle pinnacle and
crested tower, sent &lsquo;like an unperplexed question up to heaven.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So says Mr. Ruskin.&nbsp; I, for one, endorse his gallant words.&nbsp;
And I think that a strong proof of their truth is to be found in two
facts, which seem at first paradoxical.&nbsp; First, that the new Roman
Catholic churches on the Continent&mdash;I speak especially of France,
which is the most highly cultivated Romanist country&mdash;are, like
those which the Jesuits built in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
less and less Gothic.&nbsp; The former were sham-classic; the latter
are rather of a new fantastic Romanesque, or rather Byzantinesque style,
which is a real retrogression from Gothic towards earlier and less natural
schools.&nbsp; Next, that the Puritan communions, the Kirk of Scotland
and the English Nonconformists, as they are becoming more cultivated&mdash;and
there are now many highly cultivated men among them&mdash;are introducing
Gothic architecture more and more into their churches.&nbsp; There are
elements in it, it seems, which do not contradict their Puritanism;
elements which they can adapt to their own worship; namely, the very
elements which Mr. Ruskin has discerned.</p>
<p>But if they can do so, how much more can we of the Church of England?&nbsp;
As long as we go on where our medieval forefathers left off; as long
as we keep to the most perfect types of their work, in waiting for the
day when we shall be able to surpass them, by making our work even more
naturalistic than theirs, more truly expressive of the highest aspirations
of humanity: so long we are reverencing them, and that latent Protestantism
in them, which produced at last the Reformation.</p>
<p>And if any should say&mdash;&ldquo;Nevertheless, your Protestant
Gothic church, though you made it ten times more beautiful, and more
symbolic, than Cologne Minster itself, would still be a sham.&nbsp;
For where would be your images?&nbsp; And still more, where would be
your Host?&nbsp; Do you not know that in the medieval church the vistas
of its arcades, the alternations of its lights and shadows, the gradations
of its colouring, and all its carefully subordinated wealth of art,
pointed to, were concentrated round, one sacred spot, as a curve, however
vast its sweep though space, tends at every moment toward a single focus?&nbsp;
And that spot, that focus, was, and is still, in every Romish church,
the body of God, present upon the altar in the form of bread?&nbsp;
Without Him, what is all your building?&nbsp; Your church is empty:
your altar bare; a throne without a king; an eye-socket without an eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friends, if we be true children of those old worthies, whom Tacitus
saw worshipping beneath the German oaks; we shall have but one answer
to that scoff:&mdash;</p>
<p>We know it; and we glory in the fact.&nbsp; We glory in it, as the
old Jews gloried in it, when the Roman soldiers, bursting through the
Temple, and into the Holy of Holies itself, paused in wonder and in
awe when they beheld neither God, nor image of God, but blank yet all-suggestive&mdash;the
empty mercy-seat.</p>
<p>Like theirs, our altar is an empty throne.&nbsp; For it symbolises
our worship of Him who dwelleth not in temples made with hands; whom
the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain.&nbsp; Our eye-socket
holds no eye.&nbsp; For it symbolises our worship of that Eye which
is over all the earth; which is about our path, and about our bed, and
spies out all our ways.&nbsp; We need no artificial and material presence
of Deity.&nbsp; For we believe in That One Eternal and Universal Real
Presence&mdash;of which it is written &ldquo;He is not far from any
one of us; for in God we live, and move, and have our being;&rdquo;
and again, &ldquo;Lo, I am with you, even to the End of the World;&rdquo;
and again&mdash;&ldquo;Wheresoever two or three are gathered together
in My Name, there am I in the midst of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is the God of nature, as well as the God of grace.&nbsp; For ever
He looks down on all things which He has made: and behold, they are
very good.&nbsp; And, therefore, we dare offer to Him, in our churches,
the most perfect works of naturalistic art, and shape them into copies
of whatever beauty He has shown us, in man or woman, in cave or mountain
peak, in tree or flower, even in bird or butterfly.</p>
<p>But Himself?&mdash;Who can see Him?&nbsp; Except the humble and the
contrite heart, to whom He reveals Himself as a Spirit to be worshipped
in spirit and in truth, and not in bread, nor wood, nor stone, nor gold,
nor quintessential diamond.</p>
<p>So we shall obey the sound instinct of our Christian forefathers,
when they shaped their churches into forest aisles, and decked them
with the boughs of the woodland, and the flowers of the field: but we
shall obey too, that sounder instinct of theirs, which made them at
last cast out of their own temples, as misplaced and unnatural things,
the idols which they had inherited from Rome.</p>
<p>So we shall obey the sound instinct of our heathen forefathers, when
they worshipped the unknown God beneath the oaks of the primeval forest:
but we shall obey, too, that sounder instinct of theirs, which taught
them this, at least, concerning God&mdash;That it was beneath His dignity
to coop Him within walls; and that the grandest forms of nature, as
well as the deepest consciousnesses of their own souls, revealed to
them a mysterious Being, who was to be beheld by faith alone.</p>
<h2>GEORGE BUCHANAN, SCHOLAR</h2>
<p>The scholar, in the sixteenth century, was a far more important personage
than now.&nbsp; The supply of learned men was very small, the demand
for them very great.&nbsp; During the whole of the fifteenth, and a
great part of the sixteenth century, the human mind turned more and
more from the scholastic philosophy of the Middle Ages to that of the
Romans and the Greeks; and found more and more in old Pagan Art an element
which Monastic Art had not, and which was yet necessary for the full
satisfaction of their craving after the Beautiful.&nbsp; At such a crisis
of thought and taste, it was natural that the classical scholar, the
man who knew old Rome, and still more old Greece, should usurp the place
of the monk, as teacher of mankind; and that scholars should form, for
a while, a new and powerful aristocracy, limited and privileged, and
all the more redoubtable, because its power lay in intellect, and had
been won by intellect alone.</p>
<p>Those who, whether poor or rich, did not fear the monk and priest,
at least feared the &ldquo;scholar,&rdquo; who held, so the vulgar believed,
the keys of that magic lore by which the old necromancers had built
cities like Rome, and worked marvels of mechanical and chemical skill,
which the degenerate modern could never equal.</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;scholar&rdquo; stopped in a town, his hostess probably
begged of him a charm against toothache or rheumatism.&nbsp; The penniless
knight discoursed with him on alchemy, and the chances of retrieving
his fortune by the art of transmuting metals into gold.&nbsp; The queen
or bishop worried him in private about casting their nativities, and
finding their fates among the stars.&nbsp; But the statesman, who dealt
with more practical matters, hired him as an advocate and rhetorician,
who could fight his master&rsquo;s enemies with the weapons of Demosthenes
and Cicero.&nbsp; Wherever the scholar&rsquo;s steps were turned, he
might be master of others, as long as he was master of himself.&nbsp;
The complaints which he so often uttered concerning the cruelty of fortune,
the fickleness of princes, and so forth, were probably no more just
then than such complaints are now.&nbsp; Then, as now, he got his deserts;
and the world bought him at his own price.&nbsp; If he chose to sell
himself to this patron and to that, he was used and thrown away: if
he chose to remain in honourable independence, he was courted and feared.</p>
<p>Among the successful scholars of the sixteenth century, none surely
is more notable than George Buchanan.&nbsp; The poor Scotch widow&rsquo;s
son, by force of native wit, and, as I think, by force of native worth,
fights his way upward, through poverty and severest persecution, to
become the correspondent and friend of the greatest literary celebrities
of the Continent, comparable, in their opinion, to the best Latin poets
of antiquity; the preceptor of princes; the counsellor and spokesman
of Scotch statesmen in the most dangerous of times; and leaves behind
him political treatises, which have influenced not only the history
of his own country, but that of the civilised world.</p>
<p>Such a success could not be attained without making enemies, perhaps
without making mistakes.&nbsp; But the more we study George Buchanan&rsquo;s
history, the less we shall be inclined to hunt out his failings, the
more inclined to admire his worth.&nbsp; A shrewd, sound-hearted, affectionate
man, with a strong love of right and scorn of wrong, and a humour withal
which saved him&mdash;except on really great occasions&mdash;from bitterness,
and helped him to laugh where narrower natures would have only snarled,&mdash;he
is, in many respects, a type of those Lowland Scots, who long preserved
his jokes, genuine or reputed, as a common household book. <a name="citation328"></a><a href="#footnote328">{328}</a>&nbsp;
A schoolmaster by profession, and struggling for long years amid the
temptations which, in those days, degraded his class into cruel and
sordid pedants, he rose from the mere pedagogue to be, in the best sense
of the word, a courtier; &ldquo;One,&rdquo; says Daniel Heinsius, &ldquo;who
seemed not only born for a court, but born to amend it.&nbsp; He brought
to his queen that at which she could not wonder enough.&nbsp; For, by
affecting a certain liberty in censuring morals, he avoided all offence,
under the cloak of simplicity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of him and his compeers,
Turnebus, and Muretus, and their friend Andrea Govea, Ronsard, the French
court poet, said that they had nothing of the pedagogue about them but
the gown and cap.&nbsp; &ldquo;Austere in face, and rustic in his looks,&rdquo;
says David Buchanan, &ldquo;but most polished in style and speech; and
continually, even in serious conversation, jesting most wittily.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Roughhewn, slovenly, and rude,&rdquo; says Peacham, in his &lsquo;Compleat
Gentleman,&rsquo; speaking of him, probably, as he appeared in old age,
&ldquo;in his person, behaviour, and fashion; seldom caring for a better
outside than a rugge-gown girt close about him: yet his inside and conceipt
in poesie was most rich, and his sweetness and facilitie in verse most
excellent.&rdquo;&nbsp; A typical Lowland Scot, as I said just now,
he seems to have absorbed all the best culture which France could afford
him, without losing the strength, honesty, and humour which he inherited
from his Stirlingshire kindred.</p>
<p>The story of his life is easily traced.&nbsp; When an old man, he
himself wrote down the main events of it, at the request of his friends;
and his sketch has been filled out by commentators, if not always favourable,
at least erudite.&nbsp; Born in 1506, at the Moss, in Killearn&mdash;where
an obelisk to his memory, so one reads, has been erected in this century&mdash;of
a family &ldquo;rather ancient than rich,&rdquo; his father dead in
the prime of manhood, his grandfather a spendthrift, he and his seven
brothers and sisters were brought up by a widowed mother, Agnes Heriot&mdash;of
whom one wishes to know more; for the rule that great sons have great
mothers probably holds good in her case.&nbsp; George gave signs, while
at the village school, of future scholarship; and when he was only fourteen,
his uncle James sent him to the University of Paris.&nbsp; Those were
hard times; and the youths, or rather boys, who meant to become scholars,
had a cruel life of it, cast desperately out on the wide world to beg
and starve, either into self-restraint and success, or into ruin of
body and soul.&nbsp; And a cruel life George had.&nbsp; Within two years
he was down in a severe illness, his uncle dead, his supplies stopped;
and the boy of sixteen got home, he does not tell how.&nbsp; Then he
tried soldiering; and was with Albany&rsquo;s French Auxiliaries at
the ineffectual attack on Wark Castle.&nbsp; Marching back through deep
snow, he got a fresh illness, which kept him in bed all winter.&nbsp;
Then he and his brother were sent to St. Andrew&rsquo;s, where he got
his B.A. at nineteen.&nbsp; The next summer he went to France once more;
and &ldquo;fell,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;into the flames of the Lutheran
sect, which was then spreading far and wide.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two years
of penury followed; and then three years of schoolmastering in the College
of St. Barbe, which he has immortalised&mdash;at least for the few who
care to read modern Latin poetry&mdash;in his elegy on &lsquo;The Miseries
of a Parisian Teacher of the Humanities.&rsquo;&nbsp; The wretched regent
master, pale and suffering, sits up all night preparing his lecture,
biting his nails, and thumping his desk; and falls asleep for a few
minutes, to start up at the sound of the four o&rsquo;clock bell, and
be in school by five, his Virgil in one hand, and his rod in the other,
trying to do work on his own account at old manuscripts, and bawling
all the while at his wretched boys, who cheat him, and pay each other
to answer to truants&rsquo; names.&nbsp; The class is all wrong.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One is barefoot, another&rsquo;s shoe is burst, another cries,
another writes home.&nbsp; Then comes the rod, the sound of blows and
howls; and the day passes in tears.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then mass, then
another lesson, then more blows; there is hardly time to eat.&rdquo;&mdash;I
have no space to finish the picture of the stupid misery which, Buchanan
says, was ruining his intellect, while it starved his body.&nbsp; However,
happier days came.&nbsp; Gilbert Kennedy, Earl of Cassilis, who seems
to have been a noble young gentleman, took him as his tutor for the
next five years; and with him he went back to Scotland.</p>
<p>But there his plain speaking got him, as it did more than once afterward,
into trouble.&nbsp; He took it into his head to write, in imitation
of Dunbar, a Latin poem, in which St. Francis asks him in a dream to
become a Grey Friar, and Buchanan answered in language which had the
unpleasant fault of being too clever, and&mdash;to judge from contemporary
evidence&mdash;only too true.&nbsp; The friars said nothing at first:
but when King James made Buchanan tutor to one of his natural sons,
they, &ldquo;men professing meekness, took the matter somewhat more
angrily than befitted men so pious in the opinion of the people.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So Buchanan himself puts it: but, to do the poor friars justice, they
must have been angels, not men, if they did not writhe somewhat under
the scourge which he had laid on them.&nbsp; To be told that there was
hardly a place in heaven for monks, was hard to hear and bear.&nbsp;
They accused him to the king of heresy: but not being then in favour
with James, they got no answer, and Buchanan was commanded to repeat
the castigation.&nbsp; Having found out that the friars were not to
be touched with impunity, he wrote, he says, a short and ambiguous poem.&nbsp;
But the king, who loved a joke, demanded something sharp and stinging,
and Buchanan obeyed by writing, but not publishing, the &lsquo;Franciscans,&rsquo;
a long satire, compared to which the &lsquo;Somnium&rsquo; was bland
and merciful.&nbsp; The storm rose.&nbsp; Cardinal Beaton, Buchanan
says, wanted to buy him of the king, and then, of course, burn him,
as he had just burnt five poor souls: so, knowing James&rsquo;s avarice,
he fled to England, through freebooters and pestilence.</p>
<p>There he found, he says, &ldquo;men of both factions being burned
on the same day and in the same fire&rdquo;&mdash;a pardonable exaggeration&mdash;&ldquo;by
Henry VIII., in his old age more intent on his own safety than on the
purity of religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; So to his beloved France he went again,
to find his enemy Beaton ambassador at Paris.&nbsp; The capital was
too hot to hold him; and he fled south to Bourdeaux, to Andrea Govea,
the Portuguese principal of the College of Gruienne.&nbsp; As Professor
of Latin at Bourdeaux, we find him presenting a Latin poem to Charles
V.; and indulging that fancy of his for Latin poetry which seems to
us now-a-days a childish pedantry; which was then&mdash;when Latin was
the vernacular tongue of all scholars&mdash;a serious, if not altogether
a useful, pursuit.&nbsp; Of his tragedies, so famous in their day&mdash;the
&lsquo;Baptist,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Medea,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Jephtha,&rsquo;
and the &lsquo;Alcestis&rsquo;&mdash;there is neither space nor need
to speak here, save to notice the bold declamations in the &lsquo;Baptist&rsquo;
against tyranny and priestcraft; and to notice also that these tragedies
gained for the poor Scotsman, in the eyes of the best scholars of Europe,
a credit amounting almost to veneration.&nbsp; When he returned to Paris,
he found occupation at once; and&mdash;as his Scots biographers love
to record&mdash;&ldquo;three of the most learned men in the world taught
humanity in the same college,&rdquo; viz., Turnebus, Muretus, and Buchanan.</p>
<p>Then followed a strange episode in his life.&nbsp; A university had
been founded at Coimbra, in Portugal, and Andrea Govea had been invited
to bring thither what French savans he could collect.&nbsp; Buchanan
went to Portugal with his brother Patrick; two more Scotsmen, Dempster
and Ramsay: and a goodly company of French scholars, whose names and
histories may be read in the erudite pages of Dr. Irving, went likewise.&nbsp;
All prospered in the new Temple of the Muses for a year or so.&nbsp;
Then its high-priest, Govea, died; and, by a peripeteia too common in
those days and countries, Buchanan and two of his friends migrated,
unwillingly, from the Temple of the Muses for that of Moloch, and found
themselves in the Inquisition.</p>
<p>Buchanan, it seems, had said that St. Augustine was more of a Lutheran
than a Catholic on the question of the mass.&nbsp; He and his friends
had eaten flesh in Lent; which, he says, almost everyone in Spain did.&nbsp;
But he was suspected, and with reason, as a heretic; the Grey Friars
formed but one brotherhood throughout Europe; and news among them travelled
surely if not fast: so that the story of the satire written in Scotland
had reached Portugal.&nbsp; The culprits were imprisoned, examined,
bullied&mdash;but not tortured&mdash;for a year and a half.&nbsp; At
the end of that time, the proofs of heresy, it seems, were insufficient;
but lest&mdash;says Buchanan with honest pride&mdash;&ldquo;they should
get the reputation of having vainly tormented a man not altogether unknown,&rdquo;
they sent him for some months to a monastery, to be instructed by the
monks.&nbsp; &ldquo;The men,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;were neither inhuman
nor bad, but utterly ignorant of religion;&rdquo; and Buchanan solaced
himself during the intervals of their instructions, by beginning his
Latin translation of the Psalms.</p>
<p>At last he got free, and begged leave to return to France; but in
vain.&nbsp; Wearied out at last, he got on board a Candian ship at Lisbon,
and escaped to England.&nbsp; But England, he says, during the anarchy
of Edward VI.&rsquo;s reign, was not a land which suited him; and he
returned to his beloved France, to fulfil the hopes which he had expressed
in his charming &lsquo;Desiderium Lutiti&aelig;,&rsquo; and the still
more charming, because more simple, &lsquo;Adventus in Galliam,&rsquo;
in which he bids farewell, in most melodious verse, to &ldquo;the hungry
moors of wretched Portugal, and her clods fertile in naught but penury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some seven years succeeded of schoolmastering and verse-writing:&mdash;The
Latin paraphrase of the Psalms; another of the &lsquo;Alcestis&rsquo;
of Euripides; an Epithalamium on the marriage of poor Mary Stuart, noble
and sincere, however fantastic and pedantic, after the manner of the
times; &ldquo;Pomps,&rdquo; too, for her wedding, and for other public
ceremonies, in which all the heathen gods and goddesses figure; epigrams,
panegyrics, satires, much of which latter productions he would have
consigned to the dust-heap in his old age, had not his too fond friends
persuaded him to republish the follies and coarsenesses of his youth.&nbsp;
He was now one of the most famous scholars in Europe, and the intimate
friend of all the great literary men.&nbsp; Was he to go on to the end,
die, and no more?&nbsp; Was he to sink into the mere pedant; or, if
he could not do that, into the mere court versifier?</p>
<p>The wars of religion saved him, as they saved many another noble
soul, from that degradation.&nbsp; The events of 1560-1-2 forced Buchanan,
as they forced many a learned man besides, to choose whether he would
be a child of light or a child of darkness; whether he would be a dilettante
classicist, or a preacher&mdash;it might be a martyr&mdash;of the Gospel.&nbsp;
Buchanan may have left France in &ldquo;the troubles&rdquo; merely to
enjoy in his own country elegant and learned repose.&nbsp; He may have
fancied that he had found it, when he saw himself, in spite of his public
profession of adherence to the Reformed Kirk, reading Livy every afternoon
with his exquisite young sovereign; master, by her favour, of the temporalities
of Crossraguel Abbey, and by the favour of Murray, Principal of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s College in St. Andrew&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Perhaps he fancied
at times that &ldquo;to-morrow was to be as to-day, and much more abundant;&rdquo;
that thenceforth he might read his folio, and write his epigram, and
joke his joke, as a lazy comfortable pluralist, taking his morning stroll
out to the corner where poor Wishart had been burned, above the blue
sea and the yellow sands, and looking up to the castle tower from whence
his enemy Beaton&rsquo;s corpse had been hung out; with the comfortable
reflection that quietier times had come, and that whatever evil deeds
Archbishop Hamilton might dare, he would not dare to put the Principal
of St. Leonard&rsquo;s into the &ldquo;bottle dungeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If such hopes ever crossed Geordie&rsquo;s keen fancy, they were
disappointed suddenly and fearfully.&nbsp; The fire which had been kindled
in France was to reach to Scotland likewise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Revolutions
are not made with rose-water;&rdquo; and the time was at hand when all
good spirits in Scotland, and George Buchanan among them, had to choose,
once and for all, amid danger, confusion, terror, whether they would
serve God or Mammon; for to serve both would be soon impossible.</p>
<p>Which side, in that war of light and darkness, George Buchanan took,
is notorious.&nbsp; He saw then, as others have seen since, that the
two men in Scotland who were capable of being her captains in the strife
were Knox and Murray; and to them he gave in his allegiance heart and
soul.</p>
<p>This is the critical epoch in Buchanan&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; By his
conduct to Queen Mary he must stand or fall.&nbsp; It is my belief that
he will stand.&nbsp; It is not my intention to enter into the details
of a matter so painful, so shocking, so prodigious; and now that that
question is finally set at rest, by the writings both of Mr. Froude
and Mr. Burton, there is no need to allude to it further, save where
Buchanan&rsquo;s name is concerned.&nbsp; One may now have every sympathy
with Mary Stuart; one may regard with awe a figure so stately, so tragic,
in one sense so heroic,&mdash;for she reminds one rather of the heroine
of an old Greek tragedy, swept to her doom by some irresistible fate,
than of a being of our own flesh and blood, and of our modern and Christian
times.&nbsp; One may sympathise with the great womanhood which charmed
so many while she was alive; which has charmed, in later years, so many
noble spirits who have believed in her innocence, and have doubtless
been elevated and purified by their devotion to one who seemed to them
an ideal being.&nbsp; So far from regarding her as a hateful personage,
one may feel oneself forbidden to hate a woman whom God may have loved,
and may have pardoned, to judge from the punishment so swift, and yet
so enduring, which He inflicted.&nbsp; At least, he must so believe
who holds that punishment is a sign of mercy; that the most dreadful
of all dooms is impunity.&nbsp; Nay, more, those &ldquo;casket&rdquo;
letters and sonnets may be a relief to the mind of one who believes
in her guilt on other grounds; a relief when one finds in them a tenderness,
a sweetness, a delicacy, a magnificent self-sacrifice, however hideously
misplaced, which shows what a womanly heart was there; a heart which,
joined to that queenly brain, might have made her a blessing and a glory
to Scotland, had not the whole character been warped and ruinate from
childhood, by an education so abominable, that any one who knows what
words she must have heard, what scenes she must have beheld in France,
from her youth up, will wonder that she sinned so little: not that she
sinned so much.&nbsp; One may feel, in a word, that there is every excuse
for those who have asserted Mary&rsquo;s innocence, because their own
high-mindedness shrank from believing her guilty: but yet Buchanan,
in his own place and time, may have felt as deeply that he could do
no otherwise than he did.</p>
<p>The charges against him, as all readers of Scotch literature know
well, may be reduced to two heads.&nbsp; 1st. The letters and sonnets
were forgeries.&nbsp; Maitland of Lethington may have forged the letters;
Buchanan, according to some, the sonnets.&nbsp; Whoever forged them,
Buchanan made use of them in his Detection, knowing them to be forged.&nbsp;
2nd. Whether Mary was innocent or not, Buchanan acted a base and ungrateful
part in putting himself in the forefront amongst her accusers.&nbsp;
He had been her tutor, her pensioner.&nbsp; She had heaped him with
favours; and, after all, she was his queen, and a defenceless woman:
and yet he returned her kindness, in the hour of her fall, by invectives
fit only for a rancorous and reckless advocate, determined to force
a verdict by the basest arts of oratory.</p>
<p>Now as to the &ldquo;casket&rdquo; letters.&nbsp; I should have thought
they bore in themselves the best evidence of being genuine.&nbsp; I
can add nothing to the arguments of Mr. Froude and Mr. Burton, save
this: that no one clever enough to be a forger, would have put together
documents so incoherent, and so incomplete.&nbsp; For the evidence of
guilt which they contain is, after all, slight and indirect, and, moreover,
superfluous altogether; seeing that Mary&rsquo;s guilt was open and
palpable, before the supposed discovery of the letters, to every person
at home and abroad who had any knowledge of the facts.&nbsp; As for
the alleged inconsistency of the letters with proven facts: the answer
is, that whosoever wrote the letters would be more likely to know facts
which were taking place around them than any critic could be one hundred
or three hundred years afterwards.&nbsp; But if these mistakes as to
facts actually exist in them, they are only a fresh argument for their
authenticity.&nbsp; Mary, writing in agony and confusion, might easily
make a mistake: forgers would only take too good care to make none.</p>
<p>But the strongest evidence in favour of the letters and sonnets,
in spite of the arguments of good Dr. Whittaker and other apologists
for Mary, is to be found in their tone.&nbsp; A forger in those coarse
days would have made Mary write in some Semiramis or Roxana vein, utterly
alien to the tenderness, the delicacy, the pitiful confusion of mind,
the conscious weakness, the imploring and most feminine trust which
makes the letters, to those who&mdash;as I do&mdash;believe in them,
more pathetic than any fictitious sorrows which poets could invent.&nbsp;
More than one touch, indeed, of utter self-abasement, in the second
letter, is so unexpected, so subtle, and yet so true to the heart of
woman, that&mdash;as has been well said&mdash;if it was invented there
must have existed in Scotland an earlier Shakespeare; who yet has died
without leaving any other sign, for good or evil, of his dramatic genius.</p>
<p>As for the theory (totally unsupported) that Buchanan forged the
poem usually called the Sonnets; it is paying old Geordie&rsquo;s genius,
however versatile it may have been, too high a compliment to believe
that he could have written both them and the Detection; while it is
paying his shrewdness too low a compliment to believe that he could
have put into them, out of mere carelessness or stupidity, the well-known
line, which seems incompatible with the theory both of the letters and
of his own Detection; and which has ere now been brought forward as
a fresh proof of Mary&rsquo;s innocence.</p>
<p>And, as with the letters, so with the sonnets: their delicacy, their
grace, their reticence, are so many arguments against their having been
forged by any Scot of the sixteenth century, and least of all by one
in whose character&mdash;whatever his other virtues may have been&mdash;delicacy
was by no means the strongest point.</p>
<p>As for the complaint that Buchanan was ungrateful to Mary, it must
be said: That even if she, and not Murray, had bestowed on him the temporalities
of Crossraguel Abbey four years before, it was merely fair pay for services
fairly rendered; and I am not aware that payment, or even favours, however
gracious, bind any man&rsquo;s soul and conscience in questions of highest
morality and highest public importance.&nbsp; And the importance of
that question cannot be exaggerated.&nbsp; At a moment when Scotland
seemed struggling in death-throes of anarchy, civil and religious, and
was in danger of becoming a prey either to England or to France, if
there could not be formed out of the heart of her a people, steadfast,
trusty, united, strong politically because strong in the fear of God
and the desire of righteousness&mdash;at such a moment as this, a crime
had been committed, the like of which had not been heard in Europe since
the tragedy of Joan of Naples.&nbsp; All Europe stood aghast.&nbsp;
The honour of the Scottish nation was at stake.&nbsp; More than Mary
or Bothwell were known to be implicated in the deed; and&mdash;as Buchanan
puts it in the opening of his &lsquo;De Jure Regni&rsquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
fault of some few was charged upon all; and the common hatred of a particular
person did redound to the whole nation; so that even such as were remote
from any suspicion were inflamed by the infamy of men&rsquo;s crimes.&rdquo;
<a name="citation343"></a><a href="#footnote343">{343}</a></p>
<p>To vindicate the national honour, and to punish the guilty, as well
as to save themselves from utter anarchy, the great majority of the
Scotch nation had taken measures against Mary which required explicit
justification in the sight of Europe, as Buchanan frankly confesses
in the opening of his &ldquo;De Jure Regni.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chief authors
of those measures had been summoned, perhaps unwisely and unjustly,
to answer for their conduct to the Queen of England.&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth&mdash;a
fact which was notorious enough then, though it has been forgotten till
the last few years&mdash;was doing her utmost to shield Mary.&nbsp;
Buchanan was deputed, it seems, to speak out for the people of Scotland;
and certainly never people had an abler apologist.&nbsp; If he spoke
fiercely, savagely, it must be remembered that he spoke of a fierce
and savage matter; if he used&mdash;and it may be abused&mdash;all the
arts of oratory, it must be remembered that he was fighting for the
honour, and it may be for the national life, of his country, and striking&mdash;as
men in such cases have a right to strike&mdash;as hard as he could.&nbsp;
If he makes no secret of his indignation, and even contempt, it must
be remembered that indignation and contempt may well have been real
with him, while they were real with the soundest part of his countrymen;
with that reforming middle class, comparatively untainted by French
profligacy, comparatively undebauched by feudal subservience, which
has been the leaven which has leavened the whole Scottish people in
the last three centuries with the elements of their greatness.&nbsp;
If, finally, he heaps up against the unhappy Queen charges which Mr.
Burton thinks incredible, it must be remembered that, as he well says,
these charges give the popular feeling about Queen Mary; and it must
be remembered also, that that popular feeling need not have been altogether
unfounded.&nbsp; Stories which are incredible, thank God, in these milder
days, were credible enough then, because, alas! they were so often true.&nbsp;
Things more ugly than any related of poor Mary, were possible enough&mdash;as
no one knew better than Buchanan&mdash;in that very French court in
which Mary had been brought up; things as ugly were possible in Scotland
then, and for at least a century later; and while we may hope that Buchanan
has overstated his case, we must not blame him too severely for yielding
to a temptation common to all men of genius when their creative power
is roused to its highest energy by a great cause and a great indignation.</p>
<p>And that the genius was there, no man can doubt; one cannot read
that &ldquo;hideously eloquent&rdquo; description of Kirk o&rsquo; Field,
which Mr. Burton has well chosen as a specimen of Buchanan&rsquo;s style,
without seeing that we are face to face with a genius of a very lofty
order: not, indeed, of the loftiest&mdash;for there is always in Buchanan&rsquo;s
work, it seems to me, a want of unconsciousness, and a want of tenderness&mdash;but
still a genius worthy to be placed beside those ancient writers from
whom he took his manner.&nbsp; Whether or not we agree with his contemporaries,
who say that he equalled Virgil in Latin poetry, we may place him fairly
as a prose writer by the side of Demosthenes, Cicero, or Tacitus.&nbsp;
And so I pass from this painful subject; only quoting&mdash;if I may
be permitted to quote&mdash;Mr. Burton&rsquo;s wise and gentle verdict
on the whole.&nbsp; &ldquo;Buchanan,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;though a
zealous Protestant, had a good deal of the Catholic and sceptical spirit
of Erasmus, and an admiring eye for everything that was great and beautiful.&nbsp;
Like the rest of his countrymen, he bowed himself in presence of the
lustre that surrounded the early career of his mistress.&nbsp; More
than once he expressed his pride and reverence in the inspiration of
a genius deemed by his contemporaries to be worthy of the theme.&nbsp;
There is not, perhaps, to be found elsewhere in literature so solemn
a memorial of shipwrecked hopes, of a sunny opening and a stormy end,
as one finds in turning the leaves of the volume which contains the
beautiful epigram &lsquo;Nympha Caledoni&aelig;&rsquo; in one part,
the &lsquo;Detectio Mari&aelig; Regin&aelig;&rsquo; in another; and
this contrast is, no doubt, a faithful parallel of the reaction in the
popular mind.&nbsp; This reaction seems to have been general, and not
limited to the Protestant party; for the conditions under which it became
almost a part of the creed of the Church of Rome to believe in her innocence
had not arisen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Buchanan, as some of his detractors have thought, raised himself
by subserviency to the intrigues of the Regent Murray, the best heads
in Scotland seem to have been of a different opinion.&nbsp; The murder
of Murray did not involve Buchanan&rsquo;s fall.&nbsp; He had avenged
it, as far as pen could do it, by that &lsquo;Admonition Direct to the
Trew Lordis,&rsquo; in which he showed himself as great a master of
Scottish, as he was of Latin, prose.&nbsp; His satire of the &lsquo;Chameleon,&rsquo;
though its publication was stopped by Maitland, must have been read
in manuscript by many of those same &ldquo;True Lords;&rdquo; and though
there were nobler instincts in Maitland than any Buchanan gave him credit
for, the satire breathed an honest indignation against that wily turncoat&rsquo;s
misdoings, which could not but recommend the author to all honest men.&nbsp;
Therefore it was, I presume, and not because he was a rogue, and a hired
literary spadassin, that to the best heads in Scotland he seemed so
useful, it may be so worthy, a man, that he be provided with continually
increasing employment.&nbsp; As tutor to James I.; as director, for
a short time, of the chancery; as keeper of the privy seal, and privy
councillor; as one of the commissioners for codifying the laws, and
again&mdash;for in the semi-anarchic state of Scotland, government had
to do everything in the way of organisation&mdash;in the committee for
promulgating a standard Latin grammar; in the committee for reforming
the University of St. Andrew&rsquo;s: in all these Buchanan&rsquo;s
talents were again and again called for; and always ready.&nbsp; The
value of his work, especially that for the reform of St. Andrew&rsquo;s,
must be judged by Scotchmen, rather than by an Englishman: but all that
one knows of it justifies Melville&rsquo;s sentence in the well-known
passage in his memoirs, wherein he describes the tutors and household
of the young King.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. George was a Stoic philosopher,
who looked not far before him;&rdquo; in plain words, a high-minded
and right-minded man, bent on doing the duty which lay nearest him.&nbsp;
The worst that can be said against him during these times is, that his
name appears with the sum of &pound;100 against it, as one of those
&ldquo;who were to be entertained in Scotland by pensions out of England&rdquo;;
and Ruddiman, of course, comments on the fact by saying that Buchanan
&ldquo;was at length to act under the threefold character of malcontent,
reformer, and pensioner:&rdquo; but it gives no proof whatsoever that
Buchanan ever received any such bribe; and in the very month, seemingly,
in which that list was written&mdash;10th March, 1579&mdash;Buchanan
had given a proof to the world that he was not likely to be bribed or
bought, by publishing a book, as offensive probably to Queen Elizabeth
as it was to his own royal pupil; namely, his famous &lsquo;De Jure
Regni apud Scotos,&rsquo; the very primer, according to many great thinkers,
of constitutional liberty.&nbsp; He dedicates that book to King James,
&ldquo;not only as his monitor, but also an importunate and bold exactor,
which in these his tender and flexible years may conduct him in safety
past the rocks of flattery.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has complimented James already
on his abhorrence of flattery, &ldquo;his inclination far above his
years for undertaking all heroical and noble attempts, his promptitude
in obeying his instructors and governors, and all who give him sound
admonition, and his judgment and diligence in examining affairs, so
that no man&rsquo;s authority can have much weight with him unless it
be confirmed by probable reasons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Buchanan may have thought
that nine years of his stern rule had eradicated some of James&rsquo;s
ill conditions; the petulance which made him kill the Master of Mar&rsquo;s
sparrow, in trying to wrest it out of his hand; the carelessness with
which&mdash;if the story told by Chytr&aelig;us, on the authority of
Buchanan&rsquo;s nephew, be true&mdash;James signed away his crown to
Buchanan for fifteen days, and only discovered his mistake by seeing
Buchanan act in open court the character of King of Scots.&nbsp; Buchanan
had at last made him a scholar; he may have fancied that he had made
him likewise a manful man: yet he may have dreaded that, as James grew
up, the old inclinations would return in stronger and uglier shapes,
and that flattery might be, as it was after all, the cause of James&rsquo;s
moral ruin.&nbsp; He at least will be no flatterer.&nbsp; He opens the
dialogue which he sends to the king, with a calm but distinct assertion
of his mother&rsquo;s guilt, and a justification of the conduct of men
who were now most of them past helping Buchanan, for they were laid
in their graves; and then goes on to argue fairly, but to lay down firmly,
in a sort of Socratic dialogue, those very principles by loyalty to
which the House of Hanover has reigned, and will reign, over these realms.&nbsp;
So with his History of Scotland; later antiquarian researches have destroyed
the value of the earlier portions of it: but they have surely increased
the value of those later portions, in which Buchanan inserted so much
which he had already spoken out in his Detection of Mary.&nbsp; In that
book also, &ldquo;liberavit animam suam;&rdquo; he spoke his mind, fearless
of consequences, in the face of a king who he must have known&mdash;for
Buchanan was no dullard&mdash;regarded him with deep dislike, who might
in a few years be able to work his ruin.</p>
<p>But those few years were not given to Buchanan.&nbsp; He had all
but done his work, and he hastened to get it over before the night should
come wherein no man can work.&nbsp; One must be excused for telling&mdash;one
would not tell it in a book intended to be read only by Scotchmen, who
know or ought to know the tale already&mdash;how the two Melvilles and
Buchanan&rsquo;s nephew Thomas went to see him in Edinburgh, in September,
1581, hearing that he was ill, and his History still in the press; and
how they found the old sage, true to his schoolmaster&rsquo;s instincts,
teaching the Hornbook to his servant-lad; and how he told them that
doing that was &ldquo;better than stealing sheep, or sitting idle, which
was as bad,&rdquo; and showed them that dedication to James I., in which
he holds up to his imitation as a hero whose equal was hardly to be
found in history, that very King David whose liberality to the Romish
Church provoked James&rsquo;s witticism that &ldquo;David was a sair
saint for the crown.&rdquo;&nbsp; Andrew Melville, so James Melville
says, found fault with the style.&nbsp; Buchanan replied that he could
do no more for thinking of another thing, which was to die.&nbsp; They
then went to Arbuthnot&rsquo;s printing-house, and inspected the history,
as far as that terrible passage concerning Rizzio&rsquo;s burial, where
Mary is represented as &ldquo;laying the miscreant almost in the arms
of Maud de Valois, the late queen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alarmed, and not without
reason, at such plain speaking, they stopped the press, and went back
to Buchanan&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Buchanan was in bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
was going,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the way of welfare.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
asked him to soften the passage; the king might prohibit the whole work.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell me, man,&rdquo; said Buchanan, &ldquo;if I have told the
truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; They could not, or would not, deny it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
I will abide his feud, and all his kin&rsquo;s; pray, pray to God for
me, and let Him direct all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So,&rdquo; says Melville,
&ldquo;by the printing of his chronicle was ended, this most learned,
wise, and godly man ended his mortal life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Camden has a hearsay story&mdash;written, it must be remembered,
in James I.&rsquo;s time&mdash;that Buchanan, on his death-bed repented
of his harsh words against Queen Mary; and an old Lady Rosyth is said
to have said that when she was young a certain David Buchanan recollected
hearing some such words from George Buchanan&rsquo;s own mouth.&nbsp;
Those who will, may read what Ruddiman and Love have said, and oversaid,
on both sides of the question: whatever conclusion they come to, it
will probably not be that to which George Chalmers comes in his life
of Ruddiman: that &ldquo;Buchanan, like other liars, who by the repetition
of falsehoods are induced to consider the fiction as truth, had so often
dwelt with complacency on the forgeries of his Detections, and the figments
of his History, that he at length regarded his fictions and his forgeries
as most authentic facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At all events his fictions and his forgeries had not paid him in
that coin which base men generally consider the only coin worth having,
namely, the good things of this life.&nbsp; He left nothing behind him&mdash;if
at least Dr. Irving has rightly construed the &ldquo;Testament Dative&rdquo;
which he gives in his appendix&mdash;save arrears to the sum of 100<i>l</i>.
of his Crossraguel pension.&nbsp; We may believe as we choose the story
in Mackenzie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Scotch Writers,&rsquo; that when he felt
himself dying, he asked his servant Young about the state of his funds,
and finding he had not enough to bury himself withal, ordered what he
had to be given to the poor, and said that if they did not choose to
bury him they might let him lie where he was, or cast him in a ditch,
the matter was very little to him.&nbsp; He was buried, it seems, at
the expense of the city of Edinburgh, in the Greyfriars&rsquo; Churchyard&mdash;one
says in a plain turf grave&mdash;among the marble monuments which covered
the bones of worse or meaner men; and whether or not the &ldquo;Throughstone&rdquo;
which, &ldquo;sunk under the ground in the Greyfriars,&rdquo; was raised
and cleaned by the Council of Edinburgh in 1701, was really George Buchanan&rsquo;s,
the reigning powers troubled themselves little for several generations
where he lay.</p>
<p>For Buchanan&rsquo;s politics were too advanced for his age.&nbsp;
Not only Catholic Scotsmen, like Blackwood, Winzet, and Ninian, but
Protestants, like Sir Thomas Craig and Sir John Wemyss, could not stomach
the &lsquo;De Jure Regni.&rsquo;&nbsp; They may have had some reason
on their side.&nbsp; In the then anarchic state of Scotland, organisation
and unity under a common head may have been more important than the
assertion of popular rights.&nbsp; Be that as it may, in 1584, only
two years after his death, the Scots Parliament condemned his Dialogue
and History as untrue, and commanded all possessors of copies to deliver
them up, that they might be purged of &ldquo;the offensive and extraordinary
matters&rdquo; which they contained.&nbsp; The &lsquo;De Jure Regni&rsquo;
was again prohibited in Scotland, in 1664, even in manuscript; and in
1683, the whole of Buchanan&rsquo;s political works had the honour of
being burned by the University of Oxford, in company with those of Milton,
Languet, and others, as &ldquo;pernicious books, and damnable doctrines,
destructive to the sacred persons of Princes, their state and government,
and of all human society.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus the seed which Buchanan
had sown, and Milton had watered&mdash;for the allegation that Milton
borrowed from Buchanan is probably true, and equally honourable to both&mdash;lay
trampled into the earth, and seemingly lifeless, till it tillered out,
and blossomed, and bore fruit to a good purpose, in the Revolution of
1688.</p>
<p>To Buchanan&rsquo;s clear head and stout heart, Scotland owes, as
England owes likewise, much of her modern liberty.&nbsp; But Scotland&rsquo;s
debt to him, it seems to me, is even greater on the count of morality,
public and private.&nbsp; What the morality of the Scotch upper classes
was like, in Buchanan&rsquo;s early days, is too notorious; and there
remains proof enough&mdash;in the writings, for instance, of Sir David
Lindsay&mdash;that the morality of the populace which looked up to the
nobles as its example and its guide, was not a whit better.&nbsp; As
anarchy increased, immorality was likely to increase likewise; and Scotland
was in serious danger of falling into such a state as that into which
Poland fell, to its ruin, within a hundred and fifty years after; in
which the savagery of feudalism, without its order or its chivalry,
would be varnished over by a thin coating of French &ldquo;civilisation,&rdquo;
and, as in the case of Bothwell, the vices of the court of Paris should
be added to those of the Northern freebooter.&nbsp; To deliver Scotland
from that ruin, it was needed that she should be united into one people,
strong, not in mere political, but in moral ideas; strong by the clear
sense of right and wrong, by the belief in the government and the judgments
of a living God.&nbsp; And the tone which Buchanan, like Knox, adopted
concerning the great crimes of their day, helped notably that national
salvation.&nbsp; It gathered together, organised, strengthened, the
scattered and wavering elements of public morality.&nbsp; It assured
the hearts of all men who loved the right and hated the wrong; and taught
a whole nation to call acts by their just names, whoever might be the
doers of them.&nbsp; It appealed to the common conscience of men.&nbsp;
It proclaimed a universal and God-given morality, a bar at which all,
from the lowest to the highest, must alike be judged.</p>
<p>The tone was stern: but there was need of sternness.&nbsp; Moral
life and death were in the balance.&nbsp; If the Scots people were to
be told that the crimes which roused their indignation were excusable,
or beyond punishment, or to be hushed up and slipped over in any way,
there was an end of morality among them.&nbsp; Every man, from the greatest
to the least, would go and do likewise, according to his powers of evil.&nbsp;
That method was being tried in France, and in Spain likewise, during
those very years.&nbsp; Notorious crimes were hushed up under pretence
of loyalty; excused as political necessities; smiled away as natural
and pardonable weaknesses.&nbsp; The result was the utter demoralisation,
both of France and Spain.&nbsp; Knox and Buchanan, the one from the
stand-point of an old Hebrew prophet, the other rather from that of
a Juvenal or a Tacitus, tried the other method, and called acts by their
just names, appealing alike to conscience and to God.&nbsp; The result
was virtue and piety, and that manly independence of soul which is thought
compatible with hearty loyalty, in a country labouring under heavy disadvantages,
long divided almost into two hostile camps, two rival races.</p>
<p>And the good influence was soon manifest, not only in those who sided
with Buchanan and his friends, but in those who most opposed them.&nbsp;
The Roman Catholic preachers, who at first asserted Mary&rsquo;s right
to impunity, while they allowed her guilt, grew silent for shame, and
set themselves to assert her entire innocence; while the Scots who have
followed their example have, to their honour, taken up the same ground.&nbsp;
They have fought Buchanan on the ground of fact, not on the ground of
morality: they have alleged&mdash;as they had a fair right to do&mdash;the
probability of intrigue and forgery in an age so profligate: the improbability
that a Queen so gifted by nature and by fortune, and confessedly for
a long while so strong and so spotless, should as it were by a sudden
insanity have proved so untrue to herself.&nbsp; Their noblest and purest
sympathies have been enlisted&mdash;and who can blame them?&mdash;in
loyalty to a Queen, chivalry to a woman, pity for the unfortunate and&mdash;as
they conceived&mdash;the innocent; but whether they have been right
or wrong in their view of facts, the Scotch partisans of Mary have always&mdash;as
far as I know&mdash;been right in their view of morals; they have never
deigned to admit Mary&rsquo;s guilt, and then to palliate it by those
sentimental, or rather sensual, theories of human nature, too common
in a certain school of French literature,&mdash;too common, alas! in
a certain school of modern English novels.&nbsp; They have not said,
&ldquo;She did it; but after all, was the deed so very inexcusable?&rdquo;&nbsp;
They have said, &ldquo;The deed was inexcusable: but she did not do
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the Scotch admirers of Mary, who have numbered
among them many a pure and noble, as well as many a gifted spirit, have
kept at least themselves unstained; and have shown, whether consciously
or not, that they too share in that sturdy Scotch moral sense which
has been so much strengthened&mdash;as I believe&mdash;by the plain
speech of good old George Buchanan.</p>
<h2>RONDELET, THE HUGUENOT NATURALIST <a name="citation358"></a><a href="#footnote358">{358}</a></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Apollo, god of medicine, exiled from the rest of the earth,
was straying once across the Narbonnaise in Gaul, seeking to fix his
abode there.&nbsp; Driven from Asia, from Africa, and from the rest
of Europe, he wandered through all the towns of the province in search
of a place propitious for him and for his disciples.&nbsp; At last he
perceived a new city, constructed from the ruins of Maguelonne, of Lattes,
and of Substantion.&nbsp; He contemplated long its site, its aspect,
its neighbourhood, and resolved to establish on this hill of Montpellier
a temple for himself and his priests.&nbsp; All smiled on his desires.&nbsp;
By the genius of the soil, by the character of the inhabitants, no town
is more fit for the culture of letters, and above all of medicine.&nbsp;
What site is more delicious and more lovely?&nbsp; A heaven pure and
smiling; a city built with magnificence; men born for all the labours
of the intellect.&nbsp; All around vast horizons and enchanting sites&mdash;meadows,
vines, olives, green champaigns; mountains and hills, rivers, brooks,
lagoons, and the sea.&nbsp; Everywhere a luxuriant vegetation&mdash;everywhere
the richest production of the land and the water.&nbsp; Hail to thee,
sweet and dear city!&nbsp; Hail, happy abode of Apollo, who spreadest
afar the light of the glory of thy name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fine tirade,&rdquo; says Dr. Maurice Raynaud&mdash;from
whose charming book on the &lsquo;Doctors of the Time of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;
I quote&mdash;&ldquo;is not, as one might think, the translation of
a piece of poetry.&nbsp; It is simply part of a public oration by Fran&ccedil;ois
Fanchon, one of the most illustrious chancellors of the faculty of medicine
of Montpellier in the seventeenth century.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From
time immemorial,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;&lsquo;the faculty&rsquo; of
Montpellier had made itself remarkable by a singular mixture of the
sacred and the profane.&nbsp; The theses which were sustained there
began by an invocation to God, the Blessed Virgin, and St. Luke, and
ended by these words:&mdash;&lsquo;This thesis will be sustained in
the sacred Temple of Apollo.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But however extravagant Chancellor Fanchon&rsquo;s praises of his
native city may seem, they are really not exaggerated.&nbsp; The Narbonnaise,
or Languedoc, is perhaps the most charming district of charming France.&nbsp;
In the far north-east gleam the white Alps; in the far south-west the
white Pyrenees; and from the purple glens and yellow downs of the Cevennes
on the northwest, the Herault slopes gently down towards the &ldquo;Etangs,&rdquo;
or great salt-water lagoons, and the vast alluvial flats of the Camargue,
the field of Caius Marius, where still run herds of half-wild horses,
descended from some ancient Roman stock; while beyond all glitters the
blue Mediterranean.&nbsp; The great almond orchards, each one sheet
of rose-colour in spring; the mulberry orchards, the oliveyards, the
vineyards, cover every foot of available upland soil: save where the
rugged and arid downs are sweet with a thousand odoriferous plants,
from which the bees extract the famous white honey of Narbonne.&nbsp;
The native flowers and shrubs, of a beauty and richness rather Eastern
than European, have made the &lsquo;Flora Monspeliensis,&rsquo; and
with it the names of Rondelet and his disciples, famous among botanists;
and the strange fish and shells upon its shores afforded Rondelet materials
for his immortal work upon the &lsquo;Animals of the Sea.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The innumerable wild fowl of the &ldquo;Bouches du Rh&ocirc;ne;&rdquo;
the innumerable songsters and other birds of passage, many of them unknown
in these islands, and even in the north of France itself, which haunt
every copse of willow and aspen along the brook sides; the gaudy and
curious insects which thrive beneath that clear, fierce, and yet bracing
sunlight; all these have made the district of Montpellier a home prepared
by Nature for those who study and revere her.</p>
<p>Neither was Chancellor Fanchon misled by patriotism, when he said
the pleasant people who inhabit that district are fit for all the labours
of the intellect.&nbsp; They are a very mixed race, and like most mixed
races, quick-witted, and handsome also.&nbsp; There is probably much
Roman blood among them, especially in the towns; for Languedoc, or Gallia
Narbonnensis, as it was called of old, was said to be more Roman than
Rome itself.&nbsp; The Roman remains are more perfect and more interesting&mdash;so
the late Dr. Whewell used to say&mdash;than any to be seen now in Italy;
and the old capital, Narbonne itself, was a complete museum of Roman
antiquities ere Francis I. destroyed it, in order to fortify the city
upon a modern system against the invading armies of Charles V.&nbsp;
There must be much Visigothic blood likewise in Languedoc; for the Visigothic
Kings held their courts there from the fifth century, until the time
that they were crushed by the invading Moors.&nbsp; Spanish blood, likewise,
there may be; for much of Languedoc was held in the early Middle Age
by those descendants of Eudes of Acquitaine who established themselves
as kings of Majorca and Arragon; and Languedoc did not become entirely
French till 1349, when Philip le Bel bought Montpellier of those potentates.&nbsp;
The Moors, too, may have left some traces of their race behind.&nbsp;
They held the country from about A.D. 713 to 758, when they were finally
expelled by Charles Martel and Eudes.&nbsp; One sees to this day their
towers of meagre stone-work, perched on the grand Roman masonry of those
old amphitheatres, which they turned into fortresses.&nbsp; One may
see, too&mdash;so tradition holds&mdash;upon those very amphitheatres
the stains of the fires with which Charles Martel smoked them out; and
one may see, too, or fancy that one sees, in the aquiline features,
the bright black eyes, the lithe and graceful gestures, which are so
common in Languedoc, some touch of the old Mahommedan race, which passed
like a flood over that Christian land.</p>
<p>Whether or not the Moors left behind any traces of their blood, they
left behind, at least, traces of their learning; for the university
of Montpellier claimed to have been founded by Moors at a date of altogether
abysmal antiquity.&nbsp; They looked upon the Arabian physicians of
the Middle Age, on Avicenna and Averrhoes, as modern innovators, and
derived their parentage from certain mythic doctors of Cordova, who,
when the Moors were expelled from Spain in the eighth century, fled
to Montpellier, bringing with them traditions of that primeval science
which had been revealed to Adam while still in Paradise; and founded
Montpellier, the mother of all the universities in Europe.&nbsp; Nay,
some went further still, and told of Bengessaus and Ferragius, the physicians
of Charlemagne, and of Marilephus, chief physician of King Chilperic,
and even&mdash;if a letter of St. Bernard&rsquo;s was to be believed&mdash;of
a certain bishop who went as early as the second century to consult
the doctors of Montpellier; and it would have been in vain to reply
to them that in those days, and long after them, Montpellier was not
yet built.&nbsp; The facts are said to be: that as early as the beginning
of the thirteenth century Montpellier had its schools of law, medicine,
and arts, which were erected into a university by Pope Nicholas IV.
in 1289.</p>
<p>The university of Montpellier, like&mdash;I believe&mdash;most foreign
ones, resembled more a Scotch than an English university.&nbsp; The
students lived, for the most part, not in colleges, but in private lodgings,
and constituted a republic of their own, ruled by an abb&eacute; of
the scholars, one of themselves, chosen by universal suffrage.&nbsp;
A terror they were often to the respectable burghers, for they had all
the right to carry arms; and a plague likewise, for, if they ran in
debt, their creditors were forbidden to seize their books, which, with
their swords, were generally all the property they possessed.&nbsp;
If, moreover, any one set up a noisy or unpleasant trade near their
lodgings, the scholars could compel the town authorities to turn him
out.&nbsp; They were most of them, probably, mere boys of from twelve
to twenty, living poorly, working hard, and&mdash;those at least of
them who were in the colleges&mdash;cruelly beaten daily, after the
fashion of those times; but they seem to have comforted themselves under
their troubles by a good deal of wild life out of school, by rambling
into the country on the festivals of the saints, and now and then by
acting plays; notably, that famous one which Rabelais wrote for them
in 1531: &ldquo;The moral comedy of the man who had a dumb wife;&rdquo;
which &ldquo;joyous patelinage&rdquo; remains unto this day in the shape
of a well-known comic song.&nbsp; That comedy young Rondelet must have
seen acted.&nbsp; The son of a druggist, spicer, and grocer&mdash;the
three trades were then combined&mdash;in Montpellier, and born in 1507,
he had been destined for the cloister, being a sickly lad.&nbsp; His
uncle, one of the canons of Maguelonne, near by, had even given him
the revenues of a small chapel&mdash;a job of nepotism which was common
enough in those days.&nbsp; But his heart was in science and medicine.&nbsp;
He set off, still a mere boy, to Paris to study there; and returned
to Montpellier, at the age of eighteen, to study again.</p>
<p>The next year, 1530, while still a scholar himself, he was appointed
procurator of the scholars&mdash;a post which brought him in a small
fee on each matriculation&mdash;and that year he took a fee, among others,
from one of the most remarkable men of that or of any age, Fran&ccedil;ois
Rabelais himself.</p>
<p>And what shall I say of him?&mdash;who stands alone, like Shakespeare,
in his generation; possessed of colossal learning&mdash;of all science
which could be gathered in his days&mdash;of practical and statesmanlike
wisdom&mdash;of knowledge of languages, ancient and modern, beyond all
his compeers&mdash;of eloquence, which when he speaks of pure and noble
things becomes heroic, and, as it were, inspired&mdash;of scorn for
meanness, hypocrisy, ignorance&mdash;of esteem, genuine and earnest,
for the Holy Scriptures, and for the more moderate of the Reformers
who were spreading the Scriptures in Europe,&mdash;and all this great
light wilfully hidden, not under a bushel, but under a dunghill.&nbsp;
He is somewhat like Socrates in face, and in character likewise; in
him, as in Socrates, the demigod and the satyr, the man and the ape,
are struggling for the mastery.&nbsp; In Socrates, the true man conquers,
and comes forth high and pure; in Rabelais, alas! the victor is the
ape, while the man himself sinks down in cynicism, sensuality, practical
jokes, foul talk.&nbsp; He returns to Paris, to live an idle, luxurious
life; to die&mdash;says the legend&mdash;saying, &ldquo;I go to seek
a great perhaps,&rdquo; and to leave behind him little save a school
of Pantagruelists&mdash;careless young gentlemen, whose ideal was to
laugh at everything, to believe in nothing, and to gratify their five
senses like the brutes which perish.&nbsp; There are those who read
his books to make them laugh; the wise man, when he reads them, will
be far more inclined to weep.&nbsp; Let any young man who may see these
words remember, that in him, as in Rabelais, the ape and the man are
struggling for the mastery.&nbsp; Let him take warning by the fate of
one who was to him as a giant to a pigmy; and think of Tennyson&rsquo;s
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Arise, and fly<br />
The reeling faun, the sensual feast;<br />
Strive upwards, working out the beast,<br />
And let the ape and tiger die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Down among them there at Montpellier, like a
brilliant meteor, flashed this wonderful Rabelais, in the year 1530.&nbsp;
He had fled, some say, for his life.&nbsp; Like Erasmus, he had no mind
to be a martyr, and he had been terrified at the execution of poor Louis
de Berquin, his friend, and the friend of Erasmus likewise.&nbsp; This
Louis de Berquin, a man well known in those days, was a gallant young
gentleman and scholar, holding a place in the court of Francis I., who
had translated into French the works of Erasmus, Luther, and Melancthon,
and had asserted that it was heretical to invoke the Virgin Mary instead
of the Holy Spirit, or to call her our Hope and our Life, which titles&mdash;Berquin
averred&mdash;belonged alone to God.&nbsp; Twice had the doctors of
the Sorbonne, with that terrible persecutor, Noel Beda, at their head,
seized poor Berquin, and tried to burn his books and him; twice had
that angel in human form, Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me, sister
of Francis I., saved him from their clutches; but when Francis&mdash;taken
prisoner at the battle of Pavia&mdash;at last returned from his captivity
in Spain, the suppression of heresy and the burning of heretics seemed
to him and to his mother, Louise of Savoy, a thank-offering so acceptable
to God, that Louis Berquin&mdash;who would not, in spite of the entreaties
of Erasmus, purchase his life by silence&mdash;was burnt at last on
the Place de Gr&ecirc;ve, being first strangled, because he was of gentle
blood.</p>
<p>Montpellier received its famous guest joyfully.&nbsp; Rabelais was
now forty-two years old, and a distinguished savant; so they excused
him his three years&rsquo; undergraduate&rsquo;s career, and invested
him at once with the red gown of the bachelors.&nbsp; That red gown&mdash;or,
rather, the ragged phantom of it&mdash;is still shown at Montpellier,
and must be worn by each bachelor when he takes his degree.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
antiquarians assure us that the precious garment has been renewed again
and again&mdash;the students having clipped bits of it away for relics,
and clipped as earnestly from the new gowns as their predecessors had
done from the authentic original.</p>
<p>Doubtless the coming of such a man among them to lecture on the Aphorisms
of Hippocrates, and the Ars Parva of Galen, not from the Latin translations
then in use, &ldquo;but from original Greek texts, with comments and
corrections of his own, must have had a great influence on the minds
of the Montpellier students; and still more influence&mdash;and that
not altogether a good one&mdash;must Rabelais&rsquo; lighter talk have
had, as he lounged&mdash;so the story goes&mdash;in his dressing-gown
upon the public place, picking up quaint stories from the cattle-drivers
off the Cevennes, and the villagers who came in to sell their olives
and their grapes, their vinegar and their vine-twig faggots, as they
do unto this day.&nbsp; To him may be owing much of the sound respect
for natural science, and much, too, of the contempt for the superstition
around them, which is notable in that group of great naturalists who
were boys in Montpellier at that day.&nbsp; Rabelais seems to have liked
Rondelet, and no wonder: he was a cheery, lovable, honest little fellow,
very fond of jokes, a great musician and player on the violin, and who,
when he grew rich, liked nothing so well as to bring into his house
any buffoon or strolling player to make fun for him.&nbsp; Vivacious
he was, hot-tempered, forgiving, and with a power of learning and a
power of work which were prodigious, even in those hard-working days.&nbsp;
Rabelais chaffs Rondelet, under the name of Rondibilis; for, indeed,
Rondelet grew up into a very round, fat, little man; but Rabelais puts
excellent sense into his mouth, cynical enough, and too cynical, but
both learned and humorous; and, if he laughs at him for being shocked
at the offer of a fee, and taking it, nevertheless, kindly enough, Rondelet
is not the first doctor who has done that, neither will he be the last.</p>
<p>Rondelet, in his turn, put on the red robe of the bachelor, and received,
on taking his degree, his due share of fisticuffs from his dearest friends,
according to the ancient custom of the University of Montpellier.&nbsp;
He then went off to practise medicine in a village at the foot of the
Alps, and, half-starved, to teach little children.&nbsp; Then he found
he must learn Greek; went off to Paris a second time, and alleviated
his poverty there somewhat by becoming tutor to a son of the Viscomte
de Turenne.&nbsp; There he met Gonthier of Andernach, who had taught
anatomy at Louvain to the great Vesalius, and learned from him to dissect.&nbsp;
We next find him setting up as a medical man amid the wild volcanic
hills of the Auvergne, struggling still with poverty, like Erasmus,
like George Buchanan, like almost every great scholar in those days;
for students then had to wander from place to place, generally on foot,
in search of new teachers, in search of books, in search of the necessaries
of life; undergoing such an amount of bodily and mental toil as makes
it wonderful that all of them did not&mdash;as some of them doubtless
did&mdash;die under the hard training, or, at best, desert the penurious
Muses for the paternal shop or plough.</p>
<p>Rondelet got his doctorate in 1537, and next year fell in love with
and married a beautiful young girl called Jeanne Sandre, who seems to
have been as poor as he.</p>
<p>But he had gained, meanwhile, a powerful patron and the patronage
of the great was then as necessary to men of letters as the patronage
of the public is now.&nbsp; Guillaume Pellicier, Bishop of Maguelonne&mdash;or
rather then of Montpellier itself, whither he had persuaded Paul II.
to transfer the ancient see&mdash;was a model of the literary gentleman
of the sixteenth century; a savant, a diplomat, a collector of books
and manuscripts, Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac, which formed the original
nucleus of the present library of the Louvre; a botanist, too, who loved
to wander with Rondelet collecting plants and flowers.&nbsp; He retired
from public life to peace and science at Montpellier, when to the evil
days of his master, Francis I., succeeded the still worse days of Henry
II., and Diana of Poitiers.&nbsp; That Jezebel of France could conceive
no more natural or easy way of atoning for her own sins than that of
hunting down heretics, and feasting her wicked eyes&mdash;so it is said&mdash;upon
their dying torments.&nbsp; Bishop Pellicier fell under suspicion of
heresy: very probably with some justice.&nbsp; He fell, too, under suspicion
of leading a life unworthy of a celibate churchman, a fault which&mdash;if
it really existed&mdash;was, in those days, pardonable enough in an
orthodox prelate, but not so in one whose orthodoxy was suspected.&nbsp;
And for a while Pellicier was in prison.&nbsp; After his release he
gave himself up to science, with Rondelet, and the school of disciples
who were growing up around him.&nbsp; They rediscovered together the
Garum, that classic sauce, whose praises had been sung of old by Horace,
Martial, and Ausonius; and so childlike, superstitious if you will,
was the reverence in the sixteenth century for classic antiquity, that
when Pellicier and Rondelet discovered that the Garum was made from
the fish called Picarel&mdash;called Garon by the fishers of Antibes,
and Giroli at Venice, both these last names corruptions of the Latin
Gerres&mdash;then did the two fashionable poets of France, Etienne Dolet
and Clement Marot, think it not unworthy of their muse to sing the praises
of the sauce which Horace had sung of old.&nbsp; A proud day, too, was
it for Pellicier and Rondelet, when wandering somewhere in the marshes
of the Camargue, a scent of garlic caught the nostrils of the gentle
bishop, and in the lovely pink flowers of the water-germander he recognised
the Scordium of the ancients.&nbsp; &ldquo;The discovery,&rdquo; says
Professor Planchon, &ldquo;made almost as much noise as that of the
famous Garum; for at that moment of na&iuml;ve fervour on behalf of
antiquity, to rediscover a plant of Dioscorides or of Pliny was a good
fortune and almost an event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know not whether, after his death, the good bishop&rsquo;s bones
reposed beneath some gorgeous tomb, bedizened with the incongruous half-Pagan
statues of the Renaissance: but this, at least, is certain, that Rondelet&rsquo;s
disciples imagined for him a monument more enduring than of marble or
of brass, more graceful and more curiously wrought than all the sculptures
of Torrigiano or Cellini, Baccio Bandinelli or Michael Angelo himself.&nbsp;
For they named a lovely little lilac snapdragon, <i>Linaria Domini Pellicerii</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;Lord
Pellicier&rsquo;s toad-flax;&rdquo; and that name it will keep, we may
believe, as long as winter and summer shall endure.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; To this good patron&mdash;who was the Ambassador
at Venice&mdash;the newly-married Rondelet determined to apply for employment;
and to Venice he would have gone, leaving his bride behind, had he not
been stayed by one of those angels who sometimes walk the earth in women&rsquo;s
shape.&nbsp; Jeanne Sandre had an elder sister, Catherine, who had brought
her up.&nbsp; She was married to a wealthy man, but she had no children
of her own.&nbsp; For four years she and her good husband had let the
Rondelets lodge with them, and now she was a widow, and to part with
them was more than she could bear.&nbsp; She carried Rondelet off from
the students who were seeing him safe out of the city, brought him back,
settled on him the same day half her fortune, and soon after settled
on him the whole, on the sole condition that she should live with him
and her sister.&nbsp; For years afterwards she watched over the pretty
young wife and her two girls and three boys&mdash;the three boys, alas!
all died young&mdash;and over Rondelet himself, who, immersed in books
and experiments, was utterly careless about money; and was to them all
a mother, advising, guiding, managing, and regarded by Rondelet with
genuine gratitude as his guardian angel.</p>
<p>Honour and good fortune, in the worldly sense, now poured in upon
the druggist&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Pellicier, his own bishop, stood godfather
to his first-born daughter.&nbsp; Montluc, Bishop of Valence, and that
wise and learned statesman, the Cardinal of Tournon, stood godfathers
a few years later to his twin boys; and what was of still more solid
worth to him, Cardinal Tournon took him to Antwerp, Bordeaux, Bayonne,
and more than once to Rome; and in these Italian journeys of his he
collected many facts for the great work of his life, that &lsquo;History
of Fishes&rsquo; which he dedicated, naturally enough, to the cardinal.&nbsp;
This book with its plates is, for the time, a masterpiece of accuracy.&nbsp;
Those who are best acquainted with the subject say, that it is up to
the present day a key to the whole ichthyology of the Mediterranean.&nbsp;
Two other men, Belon and Salviani, were then at work on the same subject,
and published their books almost at the same time; a circumstance which
caused, as was natural, a three-cornered duel between the supporters
of the three naturalists, each party accusing the other of plagiarism.&nbsp;
The simple fact seems to be that the almost simultaneous appearance
of the three books in 1554-5 is one of those coincidences inevitable
at moments when many minds are stirred in the same direction by the
same great thoughts&mdash;coincidences which have happened in our own
day on questions of geology, biology, and astronomy; and which, when
the facts have been carefully examined, and the first flush of natural
jealousy has cooled down, have proved only that there were more wise
men than one in the world at the same time.</p>
<p>And this sixteenth century was an age in which the minds of men were
suddenly and strangely turned to examine the wonders of nature with
an earnestness, with a reverence, and therefore with an accuracy, with
which they had never been investigated before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo;
says Professor Planchon, &ldquo;long veiled in mysticism and scholasticism,
was opening up infinite vistas.&nbsp; A new superstition, the exaggerated
worship of the ancients, was nearly hindering this movement of thought
towards facts.&nbsp; Nevertheless learning did her work.&nbsp; She rediscovered,
reconstructed, purified, commented on the texts of ancient authors.&nbsp;
Then came in observation, which showed that more was to be seen in one
blade of grass than in any page of Pliny.&nbsp; Rondelet was in the
middle of this crisis a man of transition, while he was one of progress.&nbsp;
He reflected the past; he opened and prepared the future.&nbsp; If he
commented on Dioscorides, if he remained faithful to the theories of
Galen, he founded in his &lsquo;History of Fishes&rsquo; a monument
which our century respects.&nbsp; He is above all an inspirer, an initiator;
and if he wants one mark of the leader of a school, the foundation of
certain scientific doctrines, there is in his speech what is better
than all systems, the communicative power which urges a generation of
disciples along the path of independent research, with Reason for guide,
and Faith for aim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around Rondelet, in those years, sometimes indeed in his house&mdash;for
professors in those days took private pupils as lodgers&mdash;worked
the group of botanists whom Linn&aelig;us calls &ldquo;the Fathers,&rdquo;
the authors of the descriptive botany of the sixteenth century.&nbsp;
Their names, and those of their disciples and their disciples again,
are household words in the mouth of every gardener, immortalised, like
good Bishop Pellicier, in the plants which have been named after them.&nbsp;
The Lobelia commemorates Lobel, one of Rondelet&rsquo;s most famous
pupils, who wrote those &lsquo;Adversaria&rsquo; which contain so many
curious sketches of Rondelet&rsquo;s botanical expeditions, and who
inherited his botanical (as Joubert his biographer inherited his anatomical)
manuscripts.&nbsp; The Magnolia commemorates the Magnols; the Sarracenia,
Sarrasin of Lyons; the Bauhinia, Jean Bauhin; the Fuchsia, Bauhin&rsquo;s
earlier German master, Leonard Fuchs; and the Clusia&mdash;the received
name of that terrible &ldquo;Matapalo,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Scotch attorney,&rdquo;
of the West Indies, which kills the hugest tree, to become as huge a
tree itself&mdash;immortalizes the great Clusius, Charles de l&rsquo;Escluse,
citizen of Arras, who after studying civil law at Louvain, philosophy
at Marburg, and theology at Wittemberg under Melancthon, came to Montpellier
in 1551, to live in Rondelet&rsquo;s own house, and become the greatest
botanist of his age.</p>
<p>These were Rondelet&rsquo;s palmy days.&nbsp; He had got a theatre
of anatomy built at Montpellier, where he himself dissected publicly.&nbsp;
He had, says tradition, a little botanic garden, such as were springing
up then in several universities, specially in Italy.&nbsp; He had a
villa outside the city, whose tower, near the modern railway station,
still bears the name of the &ldquo;Mas de Rondelet.&rdquo;&nbsp; There,
too, may be seen the remnants of the great tanks, fed with water brought
through earthen pipes from the Fountain of Albe, wherein he kept the
fish whose habits he observed.&nbsp; Professor Planchon thinks that
he had salt-water tanks likewise; and thus he may have been the father
of all &ldquo;Aquariums.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had a large and handsome house
in the city itself, a large practice as physician in the country round;
money flowed in fast to him, and flowed out fast likewise.&nbsp; He
spent much upon building, pulling down, rebuilding, and sent the bills
in seemingly to his wife and to his guardian angel Catherine.&nbsp;
He himself had never a penny in his purse: but earned the money, and
let his ladies spend it; an equitable and pleasant division of labour
which most married men would do well to imitate.&nbsp; A generous, affectionate,
careless little man, he gave away, says his pupil and biographer, Joubert,
his valuable specimens to any savant who begged for them, or left them
about to be stolen by visitors, who, like too many collectors in all
ages, possessed light fingers and lighter consciences.&nbsp; So pacific
was he meanwhile, and so brave withal, that even in the fearful years
of the troubles, he would never carry sword, nor even tuck or dagger;
but went about on the most lonesome journeys as one who wore a charmed
life, secure in God and in his calling, which was to heal, and not to
kill.</p>
<p>These were the golden years of Rondelet&rsquo;s life; but trouble
was coming on him, and a stormy sunset after a brilliant day.&nbsp;
He lost his sister-in-law, to whom he owed all his fortunes, and who
had watched ever since over him and his wife like a mother; then he
lost his wife herself under most painful circumstances; then his best-beloved
daughter.&nbsp; Then he married again, and lost the son who was born
to him; and then came, as to many of the best in those days, even sorer
trials, trials of the conscience, trials of faith.</p>
<p>For in the mean time Rondelet had become a Protestant, like many
of the wisest men round him; like, so it would seem from the event,
the majority of the university and the burghers of Montpellier.&nbsp;
It is not to be wondered at.&nbsp; Montpellier was a sort of half-way
resting-place for Protestant preachers, whether fugitive or not, who
were passing from Basle, Geneva, or Lyons, to Marguerite of Navarre&rsquo;s
little Protestant court at Pau or at Nerac, where all wise and good
men, and now and then some foolish and fanatical ones, found shelter
and hospitality.&nbsp; Thither Calvin himself had been, passing probably
through Montpellier, and leaving&mdash;as such a man was sure to leave&mdash;the
mark of his foot behind him.&nbsp; At Lyons, no great distance up the
Rhone, Marguerite had helped to establish an organised Protestant community;
and when in 1536 she herself had passed through Montpellier, to visit
her brother at Valence, and Montmorency&rsquo;s camp at Avignon, she
took with her doubtless Protestant chaplains of her own, who spoke wise
words&mdash;it may be that she spoke wise words herself&mdash;to the
ardent and inquiring students of Montpellier.&nbsp; Moreover, Rondelet
and his disciples had been for years past in constant communication
with the Protestant savants of Switzerland and Germany, among whom the
knowledge of nature was progressing as it never had progressed before.&nbsp;
For&mdash;it is a fact always to be remembered&mdash;it was only in
the free air of Protestant countries the natural sciences could grow
and thrive.&nbsp; They sprung up, indeed, in Italy after the restoration
of Greek literature in the fifteenth century; but they withered there
again only too soon under the blighting upas shade of superstition.&nbsp;
Transplanted to the free air of Switzerland, of Germany, of Britain,
and of Montpellier, then half Protestant, they developed rapidly and
surely, simply because the air was free; to be checked again in France
by the return of superstition with despotism super-added, until the
eve of the great French Revolution.</p>
<p>So Rondelet had been for some years Protestant.&nbsp; He had hidden
in his house for a long while a monk who had left his monastery.&nbsp;
He had himself written theological treatises: but when his Bishop Pellicier
was imprisoned on a charge of heresy, Rondelet burnt his manuscripts,
and kept his opinions to himself.&nbsp; Still he was a suspected heretic,
at last seemingly a notorious one; for only the year before his death,
going to visit patients at Perpignan, he was waylaid by the Spaniards,
and had to get home through bypasses of the Pyrenees, to avoid being
thrown into the Inquisition.</p>
<p>And those were times in which it was necessary for a man to be careful,
unless he had made up his mind to be burned.&nbsp; For more than thirty
years of Rondelet&rsquo;s life the burning had gone on in his neighbourhood;
intermittently it is true: the spasms of superstitious fury being succeeded,
one may charitably hope, by pity and remorse: but still the burnings
had gone on.&nbsp; The Benedictine monk of St. Maur, who writes the
history of Languedoc, says, quite <i>en passant</i>, how some one was
burnt at Toulouse in 1553, luckily only in effigy, for he had escaped
to Geneva: but he adds, &ldquo;next year they burned several heretics,&rdquo;
it being not worth while to mention their names.&nbsp; In 1556 they
burned alive at Toulouse Jean Escalle, a poor Franciscan monk, who had
found his order intolerable; while one Pierre de Lavaur, who dared preach
Calvinism in the streets of Nismes, was hanged and burnt.&nbsp; So had
the score of judicial murders been increasing year by year, till it
had to be, as all evil scores have to be in this world, paid off with
interest, and paid off especially against the ignorant and fanatic monks
who for a whole generation, in every university and school in France,
had been howling down sound science, as well as sound religion; and
at Montpellier in 1560-1, their debt was paid them in a very ugly way.&nbsp;
News came down to the hot southerners of Languedoc of the so-called
conspiracy of Amboise.&mdash;How the Duc de Guise and the Cardinal de
Lorraine had butchered the best blood in France under the pretence of
a treasonable plot; how the King of Navarre and the Prince de Cond&eacute;
had been arrested; then how Cond&eacute; and Coligny were ready to take
up arms at the head of all the Huguenots of France, and try to stop
this lifelong torturing, by sharp shot and cold steel; then how in six
months&rsquo; time the king would assemble a general council to settle
the question between Catholics and Huguenots.&nbsp; The Huguenots, guessing
how that would end, resolved to settle the question for themselves.&nbsp;
They rose in one city after another, sacked the churches, destroyed
the images, put down by main force superstitious processions and dances;
and did many things only to be excused by the exasperation caused by
thirty years of cruelty.&nbsp; At Montpellier there was hard fighting,
murders&mdash;so say the Catholic historians&mdash;of priests and monks,
sack of the new cathedral, destruction of the noble convents which lay
in a ring round Montpellier.&nbsp; The city and the university were
in the hands of the Huguenots, and Montpellier became Protestant on
the spot.</p>
<p>Next year came the counter blow.&nbsp; There were heavy battles with
the Catholics all round the neighbourhood, destruction of the suburbs,
threatened siege and sack, and years of misery and poverty for Montpellier
and all who were therein.</p>
<p>Horrible was the state of France in those times of the wars of religion
which began in 1562; the times which are spoken of usually as &ldquo;The
Troubles,&rdquo; as if men did not wish to allude to them too openly.&nbsp;
Then, and afterwards in the wars of the League, deeds were done for
which language has no name.&nbsp; The population decreased.&nbsp; The
land lay untilled.&nbsp; The fair face of France was blackened with
burnt homesteads and ruined towns.&nbsp; Ghastly corpses dangled in
rows upon the trees, or floated down the blood-stained streams.&nbsp;
Law and order were at an end.&nbsp; Bands of robbers prowled in open
day, and bands of wolves likewise.&nbsp; But all through the horrors
of the troubles we catch sight of the little fat doctor riding all unarmed
to see his patients throughout Languedoc; going vast distances, his
biographers say, by means of regular relays of horses, till he too broke
down.&nbsp; Well for him, perhaps, that he broke down when he did; for
capture and recapture, massacre and pestilence, were the fate of Montpellier
and the surrounding country, till the better times of Henry IV. and
the Edict of Nantes in 1598, when liberty of worship was given to the
Protestants for a while.</p>
<p>In the burning summer of 1566 Rondeletius went a long journey to
Toulouse, seemingly upon an errand of charity, to settle some law affairs
for his relations.&nbsp; The sanitary state of the southern cities is
bad enough still.&nbsp; It must have been horrible in those days of
barbarism and misrule.&nbsp; Dysentery was epidemic at Toulouse then,
and Rondelet took it.&nbsp; He knew from the first that he should die.&nbsp;
He was worn out, it is said, by over-exertion; by sorrow for the miseries
of the land; by fruitless struggles to keep the peace, and to strive
for moderation in days when men were all immoderate.&nbsp; But he rode
away a day&rsquo;s journey&mdash;he took two days over it, so weak he
was&mdash;in the blazing July sun, to a friend&rsquo;s sick wife at
Realmont, and there took to his bed, and died a good man&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
The details of his death and last illness were written and published
by his cousin Claude Formy; and well worth reading they are to any man
who wishes to know how to die.&nbsp; Rondelet would have no tidings
of his illness sent to Montpellier.&nbsp; He was happy, he said, in
dying away from the tears of his household, and &ldquo;safe from insult.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He dreaded, one may suppose, lest priests and friars should force their
way to his bedside, and try to extort some recantation from the great
savant, the honour and glory of their city.&nbsp; So they sent for no
priest to Realmont: but round his bed a knot of Calvinist gentlemen
and ministers read the Scriptures, and sang David&rsquo;s psalms, and
prayed; and Rondelet prayed with them through long agonies, and so went
home to God.</p>
<p>The Benedictine monk-historian of Languedoc, in all his voluminous
folios, never mentions, as far as I can find, Rondelet&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp;
Why should he?&nbsp; The man was only a druggist&rsquo;s son and a heretic,
who healed diseases, and collected plants, and wrote a book on fish.&nbsp;
But the learned men of Montpellier, and of all Europe, had a very different
opinion of him.&nbsp; His body was buried at Realmont: but before the
schools of Toulouse they set up a white marble slab, and an inscription
thereon setting forth his learning and his virtues; and epitaphs on
him were composed by the learned throughout Europe, not only in French
and Latin, but in Greek, Hebrew, and even Chaldee.</p>
<p>So lived and so died a noble man; more noble&mdash;to my mind&mdash;than
many a victorious warrior, or successful statesman, or canonised saint.&nbsp;
To know facts, and to heal diseases, were the two objects of his life.&nbsp;
For them he toiled, as few men have toiled; and he died in harness,
at his work&mdash;the best death any man can die.</p>
<h2>VESALIUS THE ANATOMIST</h2>
<p>I cannot begin a sketch of the life of this great man better than
by trying to describe a scene so picturesque, so tragic in the eyes
of those who are wont to mourn over human follies, so comic in the eyes
of those who prefer to laugh over them, that the reader will not be
likely to forget either it or the actors in it.</p>
<p>It is a darkened chamber in the College of Alcala, in the year 1562,
where lies, probably in a huge four-post bed, shrouded in stifling hangings,
the heir-apparent of the greatest empire in the then world, Don Carlos,
only son of Philip II., and heir-apparent of Spain, the Netherlands,
and all the Indies.&nbsp; A short sickly boy of sixteen, with a bull
head, a crooked shoulder, a short leg, and a brutal temper, he will
not be missed by the world if he should die.&nbsp; His profligate career
seems to have brought its own punishment.&nbsp; To the scandal of his
father, who tolerated no one&rsquo;s vices save his own, as well as
to the scandal of the university authorities of Alcala, he has been
scouring the streets at the head of the most profligate students, insulting
women, even ladies of rank, and amenable only to his lovely young stepmother,
Elizabeth of Valois, Isabel de la Paz, as the Spaniards call her, the
daughter of Catherine de Medicis, and sister of the King of France.&nbsp;
Don Carlos should have married her, had not his worthy father found
it more advantageous for the crown of Spain, as well as more pleasant
for him Philip, to marry her himself.&nbsp; Whence came heart-burnings,
rage, jealousies, romances, calumnies, of which two last&mdash;in as
far at least as they concern poor Elizabeth&mdash;no wise man now believes
a word.</p>
<p>Going on some errand on which he had no business&mdash;there are
two stories, neither of them creditable nor necessary to repeat&mdash;Don
Carlos has fallen down stairs and broken his head.&nbsp; He comes, by
his Portuguese mother&rsquo;s side, of a house deeply tainted with insanity;
and such an injury may have serious consequences.&nbsp; However, for
nine days the wound goes on well, and Don Carlos, having had a wholesome
fright, is, according to Doctor Olivarez, the <i>medico de camara</i>,
a very good lad, and lives on chicken broth and dried plums.&nbsp; But
on the tenth day comes on numbness of the left side, acute pains in
the head, and then gradually shivering, high fever, erysipelas.&nbsp;
His head and neck swell to an enormous size; then comes raging delirium,
then stupefaction, and Don Carlos lies as one dead.</p>
<p>A modern surgeon would, probably, thanks to that training of which
Vesalius may be almost called the father, have had little difficulty
in finding out what was the matter with the luckless lad, and little
difficulty in removing the evil, if it had not gone too far.&nbsp; But
the Spanish physicians were then, as many of them are said to be still,
as far behind the world in surgery as in other things; and indeed surgery
itself was then in its infancy, because men, ever since the early Greek
schools of Alexandria had died out, had been for centuries feeding their
minds with anything rather than with facts.&nbsp; Therefore the learned
morosophs who were gathered round Don Carlos&rsquo;s sick bed had become,
according to their own confession, utterly confused, terrified, and
at their wits&rsquo; end.</p>
<p>It is the 7th of May, the eighteenth day after the accident, according
to Olivarez&rsquo; story: he and Dr. Vega have been bleeding the unhappy
prince, enlarging the wound twice, and torturing him seemingly on mere
guesses.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; says Olivarez, &ldquo;that all
was done well: but as I have said, in wounds in the head there are strange
labyrinths.&rdquo;&nbsp; So on the 7th they stand round the bed in despair.&nbsp;
Don Garcia de Toledo, the prince&rsquo;s faithful governor, is sitting
by him, worn out with sleepless nights, and trying to supply to the
poor boy that mother&rsquo;s tenderness which he has never known.&nbsp;
Alva too is there, stern, self-compressed, most terrible, and yet most
beautiful.&nbsp; He has a God on earth, and that is Philip his master;
and though he has borne much from Don Carlos already, and will have
to bear more, yet the wretched lad is to him as a son of God, a second
deity, who will by right divine succeed to the inheritance of the first;
and he watches this lesser deity struggling between life and death with
an intensity of which we, in these less loyal days, can form no notion.&nbsp;
One would be glad to have a glimpse of what passed through that mind,
so subtle and so ruthless, so disciplined and so loyal withal: but Alva
was a man who was not given to speak his mind, but to act it.</p>
<p>One would wish, too, for a glimpse of what was passing through the
mind of another man, who has been daily in that sick chamber, according
to Olivarez&rsquo; statement, since the first of the month: but he is
one who has had, for some years past, even more reason than Alva for
not speaking his mind.&nbsp; What he looked like we know well, for Titian
has painted him from the life&mdash;a tall, bold, well-dressed man,
with a noble brain, square and yet lofty, short curling locks and beard,
an eye which looks as though it feared neither man nor fiend&mdash;and
it has had good reason to fear both&mdash;and features which would be
exceeding handsome, but for the defiant snub-nose.&nbsp; That is Andreas
Vesalius, of Brussels, dreaded and hated by the doctors of the old school&mdash;suspect,
moreover, it would seem, to inquisitors and theologians, possibly to
Alva himself; for he has dared to dissect human bodies; he has insulted
the medievalists at Paris, Padua, Bologna, Pisa, Venice, in open theatre;
he has turned the heads of all the young surgeons in Italy and France;
he has written a great book, with prints in it, designed, some say,
by Titian&mdash;they were actually done by another Netherlander, John
of Calcar, near Cleves&mdash;in which he has dared to prove that Galen&rsquo;s
anatomy was at fault throughout, and that he had been describing a monkey&rsquo;s
inside when he had pretended to be describing a man&rsquo;s; and thus,
by impudence and quackery, he has wormed himself&mdash;this Netherlander,
a heretic at heart, as all Netherlanders are, to God as well as to Galen&mdash;into
the confidence of the late Emperor Charles V., and gone campaigning
with him as one of his physicians, anatomising human bodies even on
the battle-field, and defacing the likeness of Deity; and worse than
that, the most religious King Philip is deceived by him likewise, and
keeps him in Madrid in wealth and honour; and now, in the prince&rsquo;s
extreme danger, the king has actually sent for him, and bidden him try
his skill&mdash;a man who knows nothing save about bones and muscles
and the outside of the body, and is unworthy the name of a true physician.</p>
<p>One can conceive the rage of the old Spanish pedants at the Netherlander&rsquo;s
appearance, and still more at what followed, if we are to believe Hugo
Bloet of Delft, his countryman and contemporary. <a name="citation390"></a><a href="#footnote390">{390}</a>&nbsp;
Vesalius, he says, saw that the surgeons had bound up the wound so tight
that an abscess had formed outside the skull, which could not break:
he asserted that the only hope lay in opening it; and did so, Philip
having given leave, &ldquo;by two cross-cuts.&nbsp; Then the lad returned
to himself, as if awakened from a profound sleep, affirming that he
owed his restoration to life to the German doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dionysius Daza, who was there with the other physicians and surgeons,
tells a different story: &ldquo;The most learned, famous, and rare Baron
Vesalius,&rdquo; he says, advised that the skull should be trepanned;
but his advice was not followed.</p>
<p>Olivarez&rsquo; account agrees with that of Daza.&nbsp; They had
opened the wounds, he says, down to the skull before Vesalius came.&nbsp;
Vesalius insisted that the injury lay inside the skull, and wished to
pierce it.&nbsp; Olivarez spends much labour in proving that Vesalius
had &ldquo;no great foundation for his opinion:&rdquo; but confesses
that he never changed that opinion to the last, though all the Spanish
doctors were against him.&nbsp; Then on the 6th, he says, the Bachelor
Torres came from Madrid, and advised that the skull should be laid bare
once more; and on the 7th, there being still doubt whether the skull
was not injured, the operation was performed&mdash;by whom it is not
said&mdash;but without any good result, or, according to Olivarez, any
discovery, save that Vesalius was wrong, and the skull uninjured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether this second operation of the 7th of May was performed
by Vesalius, and whether it was that of which Bloet speaks, is an open
question.&nbsp; Olivarez&rsquo; whole relation is apologetic, written
to justify himself and his seven Spanish colleagues, and to prove Vesalius
in the wrong.&nbsp; Public opinion, he confesses, had been very fierce
against him.&nbsp; The credit of Spanish medicine was at stake: and
we are not bound to believe implicitly a paper drawn up under such circumstances
for Philip&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; This, at least, we gather: that Don Carlos
was never trepanned, as is commonly said; and this, also, that whichever
of the two stories is true, equally puts Vesalius into direct, and most
unpleasant, antagonism to the Spanish doctors. <a name="citation392"></a><a href="#footnote392">{392}</a></p>
<p>But Don Carlos still lay senseless; and yielding to popular clamour,
the doctors called in the aid of a certain Moorish doctor, from Valencia,
named Priotarete, whose unguents, it was reported, had achieved many
miraculous cures.&nbsp; The unguent, however, to the horror of the doctors,
burned the skull till the bone was as black as the colour of ink; and
Olivarez declares he believes it to have been a preparation of pure
caustic.&nbsp; On the morning of the 9th of May, the Moor and his unguents
were sent away, &ldquo;and went to Madrid, to send to heaven Hernando
de Vega, while the prince went back to our method of cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering what happened on the morning of the 10th of May, we should
now presume that the second opening of the abscess, whether by Vesalius
or someone else, relieved the pressure on the brain; that a critical
period of exhaustion followed, probably prolonged by the Moor&rsquo;s
premature caustic, which stopped the suppuration: but that God&rsquo;s
good handiwork, called nature, triumphed at last; and that therefore
it came to pass that the prince was out of danger within three days
of the operation.&nbsp; But he was taught, it seems, to attribute his
recovery to a very different source from that of a German knife.&nbsp;
For on the morning of the 9th, when the Moor was gone, and Don Carlos
lay seemingly lifeless, there descended into his chamber a Deus e machin&acirc;,
or rather a whole pantheon of greater or lesser deities, who were to
effect that which medical skill seemed not to have effected.&nbsp; Philip
sent into the prince&rsquo;s chamber several of the precious relics
which he usually carried about with him.&nbsp; The miraculous image
of the Virgin of Atocha, in embroidering garments for whom, Spanish
royalty, male and female, has spent so many an hour ere now, was brought
in solemn procession and placed on an altar at the foot of the prince&rsquo;s
bed; and in the afternoon there entered, with a procession likewise,
a shrine containing the bones of a holy anchorite, one Fray Diego, &ldquo;whose
life and miracles,&rdquo; says Olivarez, &ldquo;are so notorious;&rdquo;
and the bones of St. Justus and St. Pastor, the tutelar saints of the
university of Alcala.&nbsp; Amid solemn litanies the relics of Fray
Diego were laid upon the prince&rsquo;s pillow, and the sudarium, or
mortuary cloth, which had covered his face, was placed upon the prince&rsquo;s
forehead.</p>
<p>Modern science might object that the presence of so many personages,
however pious or well intentioned, in a sick chamber on a hot Spanish
May day, especially as the bath had been, for some generations past,
held in religious horror throughout Spain, as a sign of Moorish and
Mussulman tendencies, might have somewhat interfered with the chances
of the poor boy&rsquo;s recovery.&nbsp; Nevertheless the event seems
to have satisfied Philip&rsquo;s highest hopes; for that same night
(so Don Carlos afterwards related) the holy monk Diego appeared to him
in a vision, wearing the habit of St. Francis, and bearing in his hand
a cross of reeds tied with a green band.&nbsp; The prince stated that
he first took the apparition to be that of the blessed St. Francis;
but not seeing the stigmata, he exclaimed, &ldquo;How?&nbsp; Dost thou
not bear the marks of the wounds?&rdquo;&nbsp; What he replied Don Carlos
did not recollect; save that he consoled him, and told him that he should
not die of that malady.</p>
<p>Philip had returned to Madrid, and shut himself up in grief in the
great Jeronymite monastery.&nbsp; Elizabeth was praying for her step-son
before the miraculous images of the same city.&nbsp; During the night
of the 9th of May prayers went up for Don Carlos in all the churches
of Toledo, Alcala, and Madrid.&nbsp; Alva stood all that night at the
bed&rsquo;s foot.&nbsp; Don Garcia de Toledo sat in the arm-chair, where
he had now sat night and day for more than a fortnight.&nbsp; The good
preceptor, Honorato Juan, afterwards Bishop of Osma, wrestled in prayer
for the lad the whole night through.&nbsp; His prayer was answered:
probably it had been answered already, without his being aware of it.&nbsp;
Be that as it may, about dawn Don Carlos&rsquo; heavy breathing ceased;
he fell into a quiet sleep; and when he awoke all perceived at once
that he was saved.</p>
<p>He did not recover his sight, seemingly on account of the erysipelas,
for a week more.&nbsp; He then opened his eyes upon the miraculous image
of Atocha, and vowed that, if he recovered, he would give to the Virgin,
at four different shrines in Spain, gold plate of four times his weight;
and silver plate of seven times his weight, when he should rise from
his couch.&nbsp; So on the 6th of June he rose, and was weighed in a
fur coat and a robe of damask, and his weight was three arrobas and
one pound&mdash;seventy-six pounds in all.&nbsp; On the 14th of June
he went to visit his father at the episcopal palace; then to all the
churches and shrines in Alcala, and of course to that of Fray Diego,
whose body it is said he contemplated for some time with edifying devotion.&nbsp;
The next year saw Fray Diego canonised as a saint, at the intercession
of Philip and his son; and thus Don Carlos re-entered the world, to
be a terror and a torment to all around him, and to die&mdash;not by
Philip&rsquo;s cruelty, as his enemies reported too hastily indeed,
yet excusably, for they knew him to be capable of any wickedness&mdash;but
simply of constitutional insanity.</p>
<p>And now let us go back to the history of &ldquo;that most learned,
famous, and rare Baron Vesalius,&rdquo; who had stood by and seen all
these things done; and try if we cannot, after we have learned the history
of his early life, guess at some of his probable meditations on this
celebrated clinical case; and guess also how those meditations may have
affected seriously the events of his after life.</p>
<p>Vesalius (as I said) was a Netherlander, born at Brussels in 1513
or 1514.&nbsp; His father and grandfather had been medical men of the
highest standing in a profession which then, as now, was commonly hereditary.&nbsp;
His real name was Wittag, an ancient family of Wesel, on the Rhine,
from which town either he or his father adopted the name of Vesalius,
according to the classicising fashion of those days.&nbsp; Young Vesalius
was sent to college at Louvain, where he learned rapidly.&nbsp; At sixteen
or seventeen he knew not only Latin, but Greek enough to correct the
proofs of Galen, and Arabic enough to become acquainted with the works
of the Mussulman physicians.&nbsp; He was a physicist, too, and a mathematician,
according to the knowledge of those times; but his passion&mdash;the
study to which he was destined to devote his life&mdash;was anatomy.</p>
<p>Little or nothing (it must be understood) had been done in anatomy
since the days of Galen of Pergamos, in the second century after Christ,
and very little even by him.&nbsp; Dissection was all but forbidden
among the ancients.&nbsp; The Egyptians, Herodotus tells us, used to
pursue with stones and curses the embalmers as soon as they had performed
their unpleasant office; and though Herophilus and Erasistratus are
said to have dissected many subjects under the protection of Ptolemy
Soter in Alexandria itself: yet the public feeling of the Greeks as
well as of the Romans continued the same as that of the ancient Egyptians;
and Galen was fain&mdash;as Vesalius proved&mdash;to supplement his
ignorance of the human frame by describing that of an ape.&nbsp; Dissection
was equally forbidden among the Mussulmans; and the great Arabic physicians
could do no more than comment on Galen.&nbsp; The same prejudice extended
through the middle age.&nbsp; Medical men were all clerks, clerici,
and as such forbidden to shed blood.&nbsp; The only dissection, as far
as I am aware, made during the middle age was one by Mundinus in 1306;
and his subsequent commentaries on Galen&mdash;for he dare allow his
own eyes to see no more than Galen had seen before him&mdash;constituted
the best anatomical manual in Europe till the middle of the fifteenth
century.</p>
<p>Then, in Italy at least, the classic Renaissance gave fresh life
to anatomy as to all other sciences.&nbsp; Especially did the improvements
in painting and sculpture stir men up to a closer study of the human
frame.&nbsp; Leonardo da Vinci wrote a treatise on muscular anatomy:
the artist and the sculptor often worked together, and realised that
sketch of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s in which he himself is assisting Fallopius,
Vesalius&rsquo; famous pupil, to dissect.&nbsp; Vesalius soon found
that his thirst for facts could not be slaked by the theories of the
middle age; so in 1530 he went off to Montpellier, where Francis I.
had just founded a medical school, and where the ancient laws of the
city allowed the faculty each year the body of a criminal.&nbsp; From
thence, after becoming the fellow-pupil and the friend of Rondelet,
and probably also of Rabelais and those other luminaries of Montpellier,
of whom I spoke in my essay on Rondelet, he returned to Paris to study
under old Sylvius, whose real name was Jacques Dubois, <i>alias</i>
Jock o&rsquo; the Wood; and to learn less&mdash;as he complains himself&mdash;in
an anatomical theatre than a butcher might learn in his shop.</p>
<p>Were it not that the whole question of dissection is one over which
it is right to draw a reverent veil, as a thing painful, however necessary
and however innocent, it would be easy to raise ghastly laughter in
many a reader by the stories which Vesalius himself tells of his struggles
to learn anatomy.&mdash;How old Sylvius tried to demonstrate the human
frame from a bit of a dog, fumbling in vain for muscles which he could
not find, or which ought to have been there, according to Galen, and
were not; while young Vesalius, as soon as the old pedant&rsquo;s back
was turned, took his place, and, to the delight of the students, found
for him&mdash;provided it were there&mdash;what he could not find himself;&mdash;how
he went body-snatching and gibbet-robbing, often at the danger of his
life, as when he and his friend were nearly torn to pieces by the cannibal
dogs who haunted the Butte de Montfaucon, or place of public execution;&mdash;how
he acquired, by a long and dangerous process, the only perfect skeleton
then in the world, and the hideous story of the robber to whom it had
belonged&mdash;all these horrors those who list may read for themselves
elsewhere.&nbsp; I hasten past them with this remark&mdash;that to have
gone through the toils, dangers, and disgusts which Vesalius faced,
argued in a superstitious and cruel age like his, no common physical
and moral courage, and a deep conscience that he was doing right, and
must do it at all risks in the face of a generation which, peculiarly
reckless of human life and human agony, allowed that frame which it
called the image of God to be tortured, maimed, desecrated in every
way while alive; and yet&mdash;straining at the gnat after having swallowed
the camel&mdash;forbade it to be examined when dead, though for the
purpose of alleviating the miseries of mankind.</p>
<p>The breaking out of war between Francis I. and Charles V. drove Vesalius
back to his native country and Louvain; and in 1535 we hear of him as
a surgeon in Charles V.&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; He saw, most probably, the
Emperor&rsquo;s invasion of Provence, and the disastrous retreat from
before Montmorency&rsquo;s fortified camp at Avignon, through a country
in which that crafty general had destroyed every article of human food,
except the half-ripe grapes.&nbsp; He saw, perhaps, the Spanish soldiers,
poisoned alike by the sour fruit and by the blazing sun, falling in
hundreds along the white roads which led back into Savoy, murdered by
the peasantry whose homesteads had been destroyed, stifled by the weight
of their own armour, or desperately putting themselves, with their own
hands, out of a world which had become intolerable.&nbsp; Half the army
perished.&nbsp; Two thousand corpses lay festering between Aix and Fr&eacute;jus
alone.&nbsp; If young Vesalius needed &ldquo;subjects,&rdquo; the ambition
and the crime of man found enough for him in those blazing September
days.</p>
<p>He went to Italy, probably with the remnants of the army.&nbsp; Where
could he have rather wished to find himself?&nbsp; He was at last in
the country where the human mind seemed to be growing young once more;
the country of revived arts, revived sciences, learning, languages;
and&mdash;though, alas, only for a while&mdash;of revived free thought,
such as Europe had not seen since the palmy days of Greece.&nbsp; Here
at least he would be appreciated; here at least he would be allowed
to think and speak: and he was appreciated.&nbsp; The Italian cities,
who were then, like the Athenians of old, &ldquo;spending their time
in nothing else save to hear or to tell something new,&rdquo; welcomed
the brave young Fleming and his novelties.&nbsp; Within two years he
was professor of anatomy at Padua, then the first school in the world;
then at Bologna and at Pisa at the same time; last of all at Venice,
where Titian painted that portrait of him which remains unto this day.</p>
<p>These years were for him a continual triumph; everywhere, as he demonstrated
on the human body, students crowded his theatre, or hung round him as
he walked the streets; professors left their own chairs&mdash;their
scholars having deserted them already&mdash;to go and listen humbly
or enviously to the man who could give them what all brave souls throughout
half Europe were craving for, and craving in vain: facts.&nbsp; And
so, year after year, was realised that scene which stands engraved in
the frontispiece of his great book&mdash;where, in the little quaint
Cinquecento theatre, saucy scholars, reverend doctors, gay gentlemen,
and even cowled monks, are crowding the floor, peeping over each other&rsquo;s
shoulders, hanging on the balustrades; while in the centre, over his
&ldquo;subject&rdquo;&mdash;which one of those same cowled monks knew
but too well&mdash;stands young Vesalius, upright, proud, almost defiant,
as one who knows himself safe in the impregnable citadel of fact; and
in his hand the little blade of steel, destined&mdash;because wielded
in obedience to the laws of nature, which are the laws of God&mdash;to
work more benefit for the human race than all the swords which were
drawn in those days, or perhaps in any other, at the bidding of most
Catholic Emperors and most Christian Kings.</p>
<p>Those were indeed days of triumph for Vesalius; of triumph deserved,
because earned by patient and accurate toil in a good cause: but Vesalius,
being but a mortal man, may have contracted in those same days a temper
of imperiousness and self-conceit, such as he showed afterwards when
his pupil Fallopius dared to add fresh discoveries to those of his master.&nbsp;
And yet, in spite of all Vesalius knew, how little he knew!&nbsp; How
humbling to his pride it would have been had he known then&mdash;perhaps
he does know now&mdash;that he had actually again and again walked,
as it were, round and round the true theory of the circulation of the
blood, and yet never seen it; that that discovery which, once made,
is intelligible, as far as any phenomenon is intelligible, to the merest
peasant, was reserved for another century, and for one of those Englishmen
on whom Vesalius would have looked as semi-barbarians.</p>
<p>To make a long story short: three years after the publication of
his famous book, &lsquo;De Corporis Humani Fabrica,&rsquo; he left Venice
to cure Charles V., at Regensburg, and became one of the great Emperor&rsquo;s
physicians.</p>
<p>This was the crisis of Vesalius&rsquo; life.&nbsp; The medicine with
which he had worked the cure was China&mdash;Sarsaparilla, as we call
it now&mdash;brought home from the then newly-discovered banks of the
Paraguay and Uruguay, where its beds of tangled vine, they say, tinge
the clear waters a dark brown like that of peat, and convert whole streams
into a healthful and pleasant tonic.&nbsp; On the virtues of this China
(then supposed to be a root) Vesalius wrote a famous little book, into
which he contrived to interweave his opinions on things in general,
as good Bishop Berkeley did afterwards into his essay on the virtues
of tar-water.&nbsp; Into this book, however, Vesalius introduced&mdash;as
Bishop Berkeley did not&mdash;much, and perhaps too much, about himself;
and much, though perhaps not too much, about poor old Galen, and his
substitution of an ape&rsquo;s inside for that of a human being.&nbsp;
The storm which had been long gathering burst upon him.&nbsp; The old
school, trembling for their time-honoured reign, bespattered, with all
that pedantry, ignorance, and envy could suggest, the man who dared
not only to revolutionise surgery, but to interfere with the privileged
mysteries of medicine; and, over and above, to become a favourite at
the court of the greatest of monarchs.&nbsp; While such as Eustachius,
himself an able discoverer, could join in the cry, it is no wonder if
a lower soul, like that of Sylvius, led it open-mouthed.&nbsp; He was
a mean, covetous, bad man, as George Buchanan well knew; and, according
to his nature, he wrote a furious book, &lsquo;Ad Vesani calumnias depulsandas.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The punning change of Vesalius into Vesanus (madman) was but a fair
and gentle stroke for a polemic, in days in which those who could not
kill their enemies with steel or powder, held themselves justified in
doing so, if possible, by vituperation, culumny, and every engine of
moral torture.&nbsp; But a far more terrible weapon, and one which made
Vesalius rage, and it may be for once in his life tremble, was the charge
of impiety and heresy.&nbsp; The Inquisition was a very ugly place.&nbsp;
It was very easy to get into it, especially for a Netherlander: but
not so easy to get out.&nbsp; Indeed Vesalius must have trembled, when
he saw his master, Charles V., himself take fright, and actually call
on the theologians of Salamanca to decide whether it was lawful to dissect
a human body.&nbsp; The monks, to their honour, used their common sense,
and answered Yes.&nbsp; The deed was so plainly useful, that it must
be lawful likewise.&nbsp; But Vesalius did not feel that he had triumphed.&nbsp;
He dreaded, possibly, lest the storm should only have blown over for
a time.&nbsp; He fell, possibly, into hasty disgust at the folly of
mankind, and despair of arousing them to use their common sense, and
acknowledge their true interest and their true benefactors.&nbsp; At
all events, he threw into the fire&mdash;so it is said&mdash;all his
unpublished manuscripts, the records of long years of observation, and
renounced science thenceforth.</p>
<p>We hear of him after this at Brussels, and at Basle likewise&mdash;in
which latter city, in the company of physicians, naturalists, and Grecians,
he must have breathed awhile a freer air.&nbsp; But he seems to have
returned thence to his old master Charles V., and to have finally settled
at Madrid as a court surgeon to Philip II., who sent him, but too late,
to extract the lance splinters from the eye of the dying Henry II.</p>
<p>He was now married to a lady of rank from Brussels, Anne van Hamme
by name; and their daughter married in time Philip II.&rsquo;s grand
falconer, who was doubtless a personage of no small social rank.&nbsp;
He was well off in worldly things; somewhat fond, it is said, of good
living and of luxury; inclined, it may be, to say, &ldquo;Let us eat
and drink, for to-morrow we die,&rdquo; and to sink more and more into
the mere worldling, unless some shock awoke him from his lethargy.</p>
<p>And the awakening shock did come.&nbsp; After eight years of court
life, he resolved early in the year 1564 to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The reasons for so strange a determination are wrapped in mystery
and contradiction.&nbsp; The common story was that he had opened a corpse
to ascertain the cause of death, and that, to the horror of the bystanders,
the heart was still seen to beat; that his enemies accused him to the
Inquisition, and that he was condemned to death, a sentence which was
commuted to that of going on pilgrimage.&nbsp; But here, at the very
outset, accounts differ.&nbsp; One says that the victim was a nobleman,
name not given; another that it was a lady&rsquo;s maid, name not given.&nbsp;
It is most improbable, if not impossible, that Vesalius, of all men,
should have mistaken a living body for a dead one; while it is most
probable, on the other hand, that his medical enemies would gladly raise
such a calumny against him, when he was no longer in Spain to contradict
it.&nbsp; Meanwhile Llorente, the historian of the Inquisition, makes
no mention of Vesalius having been brought before its tribunal, while
he does mention Vesalius&rsquo; residence at Madrid.&nbsp; Another story
is, that he went abroad to escape the bad temper of his wife; another
that he wanted to enrich himself.&nbsp; Another story&mdash;and that
not an unlikely one&mdash;is, that he was jealous of the rising reputation
of his pupil Fallopius, then professor of anatomy at Venice.&nbsp; This
distinguished surgeon, as I said before, had written a book, in which
he had added to Vesalius&rsquo; discoveries, and corrected certain errors
of his.&nbsp; Vesalius had answered him hastily and angrily, quoting
his anatomy from memory; for, as he himself complained, he could not
in Spain obtain a subject for dissection; not even, he said, a single
skull.&nbsp; He had sent his book to Venice to be published, and had
heard, seemingly, nothing of it.</p>
<p>He may have felt that he was falling behind in the race of science,
and that it was impossible for him to carry on his studies in Madrid;
and so, angry with his own laziness and luxury, he may have felt the
old sacred fire flash up in him, and have determined to go to Italy
and become a student and a worker once more.</p>
<p>The very day that he set out, Clusius of Arras, then probably the
best botanist in the world, arrived at Madrid; and, asking the reason
of Vesalius&rsquo; departure, was told by their fellow-countryman, Charles
de Tisnacq, procurator for the affairs of the Netherlands, that Vesalius
had gone of his own free will, and with all facilities which Philip
could grant him, in performance of a vow which he had made during a
dangerous illness.&nbsp; Here, at least, we have a drop of information,
which seems taken from the stream sufficiently near to the fountain-head:
but it must be recollected that De Tisnacq lived in dangerous times,
and may have found it necessary to walk warily in them; that through
him had been sent, only the year before, that famous letter from William
of Orange, Horn, and Egmont, the fate whereof may be read in Mr. Motley&rsquo;s
fourth chapter; that the crisis of the Netherlands which sprung out
of that letter was coming fast; and that, as De Tisnacq was on friendly
terms with Egmont, he may have felt his head at times somewhat loose
on his shoulders; especially if he had heard Alva say, as he wrote,
&ldquo;that every time he saw the despatches of those three se&ntilde;ors,
they moved his choler so, that if he did not take much care to temper
it, he would seem a frenzied man.&rdquo;&nbsp; In such times, De Tisnacq
may have thought good to return a diplomatic answer to a fellow-countryman
concerning a third fellow-countryman, especially when that countryman,
as a former pupil of Melancthon at Wittemberg, might himself be under
suspicion of heresy, and therefore of possible treason.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, one cannot but suspect some strain of truth in
the story about the Inquisition; perhaps in that, also, of his wife&rsquo;s
unkindness; for, whether or not Vesalius operated on Don Carlos, he
had seen with his own eyes that miraculous Virgin of Atocha at the bed&rsquo;s
foot of the prince.&nbsp; He had heard his recovery attributed, not
to the operation, but to the intercession of Fray, now Saint, Diego;
<a name="citation408"></a><a href="#footnote408">{408}</a> and he must
have had his thoughts thereon, and may, in an unguarded moment, have
spoken them.</p>
<p>For he was, be it always remembered, a Netherlander.&nbsp; The crisis
of his country was just at hand.&nbsp; Rebellion was inevitable, and,
with rebellion, horrors unutterable; and, meanwhile, Don Carlos had
set his mad brain on having the command of the Netherlands.&nbsp; In
his rage at not having it, as all the world knows, he nearly killed
Alva with his own hands, some two years after.&nbsp; If it be true that
Don Carlos felt a debt of gratitude to Vesalius, he may (after his wont)
have poured out to him some wild confidence about the Netherlands, to
have even heard which would be a crime in Philip&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
And if this be but a fancy, still Vesalius was, as I just said, a Netherlander,
and one of a brain and a spirit to which Philip&rsquo;s doings, and
the air of the Spanish court, must have been growing even more and more
intolerable.&nbsp; Hundreds of his country folk, perhaps men and women
whom he had known, were being racked, burnt alive, buried alive, at
the bidding of a jocular ruffian, Peter Titelmann, the chief inquisitor.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;day of the <i>mau-brulez</i>,&rdquo; and the wholesale massacre
which followed it, had happened but two years before; and, by all the
signs of the times, these murders and miseries were certain to increase.&nbsp;
And why were all these poor wretches suffering the extremity of horror,
but because they would not believe in miraculous images, and bones of
dead friars, and the rest of that science of unreason and unfact, against
which Vesalius had been fighting all his life, consciously or not, by
using reason and observing fact?&nbsp; What wonder if, in some burst
of noble indignation and just contempt, he forgot a moment that he had
sold his soul, and his love of science likewise, to be a luxurious,
yet uneasy, hanger-on at the tyrant&rsquo;s court; and spoke unadvisedly
some word worthy of a German man?</p>
<p>As to the story of his unhappy quarrels with his wife, there may
be a grain of truth in it likewise.&nbsp; Vesalius&rsquo; religion must
have sat very lightly on him.&nbsp; The man who had robbed churchyards
and gibbets from his youth was not likely to be much afraid of apparitions
and demons.&nbsp; He had handled too many human bones to care much for
those of saints.&nbsp; He was probably, like his friends of Basle, Montpellier,
and Paris, somewhat of a heretic at heart, probably somewhat of a pagan.&nbsp;
His lady, Anne van Hamme, was probably a strict Catholic, as her father,
being a councillor and master of the exchequer at Brussels, was bound
to be; and freethinking in the husband, crossed by superstition in the
wife, may have caused in them that wretched vie &agrave; part, that
want of any true communion of soul, too common to this day in Catholic
countries.</p>
<p>Be these things as they may&mdash;and the exact truth of them will
now be never known&mdash;Vesalius set out to Jerusalem in the spring
of 1564.&nbsp; On his way he visited his old friends at Venice to see
about his book against Fallopius.&nbsp; The Venetian republic received
the great philosopher with open arms.&nbsp; Fallopius was just dead;
and the senate offered their guest the vacant chair of anatomy.&nbsp;
He accepted it: but went on to the East.</p>
<p>He never occupied that chair; wrecked upon the Isle of Zante, as
he was sailing back from Palestine, he died miserably of fever and want,
as thousands of pilgrims returning from the Holy Land had died before
him.&nbsp; A goldsmith recognised him; buried him in a chapel of the
Virgin; and put up over him a simple stone, which remained till late
years; and may remain, for aught I know, even now.</p>
<p>So perished, in the prime of life, &ldquo;a martyr to his love of
science,&rdquo; to quote the words of M. Burggraeve of Ghent, his able
biographer and commentator, &ldquo;the prodigious man, who created a
science at an epoch when everything was still an obstacle to his progress;
a man whose whole life was a long struggle of knowledge against ignorance,
of truth against lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plaudite: Exeat: with Rondelet and Buchanan.&nbsp; And whensoever
this poor foolish world needs three such men, may God of his great mercy
send them.</p>

In justice to poor Doctor Olivarez, it must be said, that while he allows
all force to the intercession of the Virgin and of Fray Diego, and of
&ldquo;many just persons,&rdquo; he cannot allow that there was any
&ldquo;miracle properly so called,&rdquo; because the prince was cured
according to &ldquo;natural order,&rdquo; and by &ldquo;experimented
remedies&rdquo; of the physicians.</p>

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
